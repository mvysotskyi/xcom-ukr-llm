The actual pre-war ‘Elite’ units got wiped off the face of the Earth after getting paratrooped to every airport possible without any actual support or gunning it straight to Kyiv along the major highways with no recon or air cover. Since then, I honestly think the “elite” units are what most militaries would consider basic combat troops (ie generally competent, but not exactly Rambo) but with shiny name tags.

"Satellite Imagery Confirms Destruction at Khanskaya Air Base After Drone Strike","No idea how Ukraine is getting it's intelligence, but damn it's good.  From the article:  ""...during the attack on the Khanskaya airfield in Adygea, one of the drones hit an ammunition depot. This resulted in the detonation of an Kh-31 missile, three Kh-35 missiles, and 15 D-30 UMPB bombs.In addition, 41 UMPK unified gliding and correction kits were lost, and a UAV struck the runway, causing damage.""That's 4 missiles and 15 bombs that will never terrorize Ukraine.  Well done AFU!"
"Satellite Imagery Confirms Destruction at Khanskaya Air Base After Drone Strike","👍👍👍👍…but they have to destroy air frames.  RuZZians won’t be able to use glide bombs if they lack the airframes.

"President Zelenskyy was treated to a warm welcome when he landed in Germany 🇩🇪🇺🇦❤️","This is entirely unrelated to Zelensky and his tireless diplomacy.  But how is it that sailors of every nation always somehow manage to look ever so slightly less clean-cut than members of other uniformed services?"
"President Zelenskyy was treated to a warm welcome when he landed in Germany 🇩🇪🇺🇦❤️","Have people finally stopped shitting on Germany? They go so much hassle for apparently not helping enough... But from what I can see, they've been amazing supporters of Ukraine."

"President Zelenskyy was treated to a warm welcome when he landed in Germany 🇩🇪🇺🇦❤️","It never occurred to me that Germany still uses Mauser K98k's for ceremonial guard's arms.Countries with domestic production may use their indigenous arms. France, Finland, Italy, and England use modern firearms. It's a longer walk back to use outdated *traditional* firearms.For example, The US still uses a whole catalog of firearms from 1903's, 1917's, Garands, or even the semi-modern M14. Japan still uses Type 99 Arisakas. Sweden is often seen with the Carl-Gustav Mausers. Spain uses their contract Mausers. Czechia uses VZ52 carbines and Mausers. Former Soviet nations and influenced nations tend to use the SKS. However, there are countries with imported contract arms, guns that were specially made for them. And they don't use their traditional contracts. Like Thailand doesn't use the old Type 66 Siamese Mauser imported from Japan. Iran definitely doesn't use the traditional Persian Mausers. Instead their guys use M16's and gilded Tavor21's. Kinda on a geek tangent."

Why is this, and is a German thing or do US soldiers also do this depending on the situation?"

"President Zelenskyy was treated to a warm welcome when he landed in Germany 🇩🇪🇺🇦❤️","cool do they still use KAR98Ks as ceremonial rifles? I guess the US Army does still use the M1 Garand or the M14. The 98K does have a long history with the german army."

"Zelenskyy was asked after his meeting with Macron on the possibilities of a ceasefire","Signing ceasefires(Ukraine signed a lot of them with Russia since 2014, look up Minsk Agreements), with France and Germany's mediation, is what enabled and emboldened Russia's full scale invasion in the first place.Any idiot who wants to repeat that process again ""for peace"", might as well start putting down red carpets from Putin's old Dresden office to the Kremlin.

Anytime you read that, or that Ukraine ""had a treaty"" in Turkey in 2022 and then refused to sign, or any other similar information know that it is 100% false, and the source is ruzzian propaganda.  On some ruzzian subs they ""wax poetic"" about how negotiations had arrived at a result and then Ukraine backed out at the last moment, and quote various Ukraine social media as proof.

The pollution is so extensive that the occupation authorities in many cities on the southern coast have banned the use of beaches.> > Vasylyuk also noted that large-scale military exercises, which were held in the protected areas of the Kerch Peninsula, in particular in the Opuk Nature Reserve, caused significant damage to the nature of the peninsula. During the exercises, the occupiers launched rocket attacks, damaging the mountainous areas of the reserve.> > In addition, the construction of the Crimean bridge had a negative impact on the ecosystem. The closure of the Kerch Strait created obstacles for the migration of dolphins and fish that reproduce in the Sea of Azov and move to the Black Sea.> > The expert also drew attention to the fact that Crimea’s environment suffers from large-scale development and construction of new military bases.

That's why freedom of speech is so powerful and that's why Russia doesn't allow it because they know what they're guilty of and they know what will happen if their people start talking about this so they've stepped in to control what the news agencies in Russa report.

UAO collects military artifacts provided by Ukrainian soldiers and works with local artists in Ukraine to incorporate them into art. Our objective is to convert remnants of conflict into artwork with the idea of art defeating the aggressor's evil. The produced artwork will be auctioned and proceeds will be used to equip the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Since the start of the war, there have been many art-related fundraising initiatives, but what makes this one unique is that we seek to incorporate destroyed military artifacts. By doing this, artwork will serve as a scribe and a reminder of Russian atrocities inflicted on Ukraine. The Victory Gallery offers worldwide shipping.Link: [https://ukraineaidops.org/collections/ready-to-ship](https://ukraineaidops.org/collections/ready-to-ship)**For info:** Ukraine Aid Operations is an  verified organization & registered as 501(c)(3) charity"

"Losses of the Russian military to 11.10.2024","On the front lines, the Russian army’s offensive continued in the same directions.- In the Kursk region, Russian sources report that the Russian army has gained control over two settlements, but there has been no confirmation of this. Battles are ongoing at several points, but the Russian army has not yet managed to launch a major offensive.- In the northern part of Vovchansk in the Kharkiv direction, battles continue and there have been no significant changes in the situation.- A very active offensive continues towards the cities of Kupiansk and Lyman. Yesterday, the Russian army was not able to make significant progress. Social media channels reported advancements by Russian units in the Siversk direction yesterday. However, there has been no confirmation of this, and according to Ukrainian sources, it was relatively quiet in this sector.- In the Bahmut area, the pressure continues towards Chasiv Yar, but Russian units have not managed to improve their positions. Serious urban battles continue on the southern and eastern edges of Toretsk city. Since predominantly small infantry units operate in the grey zone of the front line, the situation in this limited area is very fluid. The Russian army has not achieved any major advancements.- On the Pokrovsk city direction, the pressure from Russian units slightly increased yesterday, but they only managed marginal improvements in their positions. The most severe attacks are continuing southwest of Donetsk, where Russian units have managed to move forward slightly in some points.- On the southern front, Russian units conducted a few reconnaissance battles and were generally passive. The local Ukrainian military command continues active communication, indicating that Russian units are preparing for a larger offensive in this area."

"Handing out snacks and goods at a local church and rehab center","Every time we go to Ukraine, we bring plenty of fries and snacks, and sometimes we have some leftovers at the end. We then distribute these at refugee shelters or churches. This time, we visited a shelter, a church, and a rehabilitation center. We handed out all the remaining treats, such as snacks and drinks, to cheer people up and give them some encouragement. It's a small gesture, but it gives people a bit of hope and support. It reminds them that they are not forgotten.Music by [Океан Ельзи](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCjJ-oj2aJTINILYLDv2MFEQ)[Join us and help us](https://www.frankyandcoen.nl/en/doneer-nu)"

"How people met Zelenskyy in Croatia","Even though most of the people on the video are tourists, huge majority of Croats support Ukraine and that's expected considering we were in the same situation in the 90's. Croatia also doesn't have any political party that supports Russia nor any pro-Russia movement for same reasons. You'll obviously find people that support Russia and all of them are brainwashed through Serbian propaganda outlets which are used by Russia to spread disinformation throughout the Balkans. Also, I tend to notice that people who support Russia here are massive conspiracy theorists, anti-vaxxers and ""break the system"" type.If you're still not sure how much Croatia supports Ukraine... let's just say we sent Let 3 to Eurovision with provocative song Mama ŠČ! ([official video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyKj8jA0Qoc) or [chaotic performance at Dora](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=isZ_4AnCTnA)) that makes fun of Putin and Russia. People loved the song so much it sparked massive interest in Eurovision again and was constantly playing on radio stations throughout Croatia.Take a look at this survey done by RTL at the beginning of the war in 2022: [https://imgur.com/a/43zu9z4](https://imgur.com/a/43zu9z4)"

"If you have coin, Kilderov has stickers! Raffling a limited-edition set signed by Budanov (yep!), selling a limited-edition set signed by Kilderov!","  (If you don't know u/kilderov, you're missing out. He's a great guy doing great work for Ukraine. Ask him sometime about how he got that demining suit for his guys.)    Nova Kakhovka-born artist Maxim Kilderov is relentlessly creative and resourceful in his support of the Armed Forces of Ukraine. For over two years now, he's been amassing war trophies and artifacts for the Art Forces of Ukraine Museum, which records the history of the war in a visceral, tangible way.    Kilderov builds the museum's collection by fulfilling requests from soldiers at the front. The soldiers, in turn, provide objects for the collection. It's a win-win-win situation.    **This week, he's doing something rather special: He's raffling a limited-edition stickerpack signed by Budanov, and selling a limited-edition stickerpack signed by Kilderov.**    Every dollar from both enterprises supports the win-win-win.    He writes:    Art Forces started its activity in 2022, with the volunteer activity of Maxim Kilderov, who painted on used weapons and sold them to support the army. Thanks to the sales of military art in 2023, it was possible to send donations to the Ukrainian army and humanitarian mission in the amount of more than 2.5 million hryvnias (over $60,000 US). This is how the Art Forces Museum was gradually formed. It contains military objects - used grenade launchers, knives, personal belongings of enemies; pieces of equipment, missiles, and aircraft; and evidence of crimes of the Russian army in Ukraine. In the future, the museum will become a full-fledged institution.The year 2024 brought negative changes: sales fell several times, which affected both volunteer activities and the maintenance of the museum.We are collecting as much money as possible to keep the museum running. The money that will be collected will become the museum's fund: it will fund the warriors' requests, and in turn the warriors will send new war artifacts to the museum if possible, growing its collection.In this raffle you will be able to compete for a stickerpack signed by Kyrylo Budanov. You can also buy a stickerpack signed by me.We will be glad to have your support!    [**Buy your tickets and stickers here!**](https://givebutter.com/art_forces_2)"

The authors of the texts are responsible for the materials in the ""Blogs"" section.Let's help our military with nets23:22 10/10/2024 17985Friends! If you were not frightened by my photo in camouflage autumn nets,then my bowing request - to donate a penny to the Sumy ""Bees"" - a brigade of pensioners from Sumy, who weave protective nets for our military, will not scare you.If it were my will, I would award the brigade itself with an order, and its masters and craftsmen with medals, for their contribution to the security of the Armed Forces and not only.But I do thatwhat I can do: I collect money for a group of ploughmen for material to weave nets - from 8 in the morning until late in the evening.Recently, ""Bees"" counted how much nets they wove this year alone - 6,750 meters of nets were obtained, and the base was 3 meters wide. The list of their ""clients"" is impressive: 46th Airborne Assault Brigade, 2nd Air Force of the Sumy PKSHR. 93rd Airborne Assault Brigade,27 jet brigade. 155th Dobrobat battalion, 15th separate rifle battalion, 110th battalion of the Armed Forces of the RVP. 8 benefits DFTG-8. 152nd brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine TRO...Well, since the summer, the ""Bees"" have been working in an extremely heavy mode - Sumyshchyna, which is near Kurshchyna, the region is now filled with military personnel, the logistics are clear, you know the statistics of Russian shelling of Sumyshchyna and Kurshchyna, I thinkalso saw The demand for nets is crazy, no less than for Mavika and REB. It's not about decor, it's about the lives of thousands of our soldiers, who are fired upon with all kinds of weapons. And it is necessary that ours are not seen and, accordingly, they are not attacked. For this, these nets are needed - in huge quantities.Currently in demand is the autumn season of nets - green-yellow-brown color The phones at ""Bzhilok"" are full of orders from the military - and everyone needs them ""for yesterday"". And the age of our heroes/heroines is from 55 to 73, and it is difficult to call them wealthy. Strokes, heart attacks, kidney stones - and the list goes on. All this is carried over in silence: lay down - and go to the workplace - to weave. Physically difficult, but mentally -it's easy: people know that they really help the Armed Forces of Ukraine and Ukraine.And how can you and I help ""Bees""? We can donate - whoever can, how much - for the material for the nets. The material is called spunbond, and ""Bees"" - and here they are: Oleksandr, Larisa, Svitlana, Valentina, Vera, Raya, Zina, Svitlana, Valentina, Viktor, Yurii Mykhailovych, Serhiy, Viktor, Shura,Halyna, Raya, Ninel, Iryna, Olya, Zhenya.Shall we help?If you want to help, please donate here:5168 7554 7338 2303 Fedenko LarisaCOME ON"

The United States of America, the Russian Federation, and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland, reaffirm their commitment to seek immediate United Nations Security Council action to provide assistance to Ukraine, as a non-nuclear-weapon State Party to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, if Ukraine should become a victim of an act of aggression or an object of a threat of aggression in which nuclear weapons are used.>5.

The signatories promised to seek UN security council action should Ukraine be attacked with nuclear weapons, and offered a complicated promise to not themselves use nuclear weapons against Ukraine unless they were themselves attacked by an alliance that included nuclear states.In the early 1990s, there was a large and in many cases corrupt arms trade between former Soviet states (including Ukraine) and the developing world, and national security establishments in the US and UK were spooked about the prospect of Soviet nukes falling into terrorist/insurgent hands. To Western foreign policy experts, Moscow was a known entity at the time, no one knew how stable Kyiv would be.

"Status Quo then","IIRC from looking into it when the conflict started, Ukraine didn't even have the capability to use or maintain the nukes (as they were Soviet weapons with the keys in Moscow, and they were aging and very expensive to maintain). The Budapest Memorandum was basically them trying to scrape some benefit out of weapons they already needed to get rid of. And the US was happy to be able to just sign some papers to reduce the number of nuclear powers (we also threw quite a bit of monetary aid at them). It sucks that they didn't get stronger guarantees out of the deal but there was never a scenario where they maintain nuclear power status and there's no way in hell any country in the Western sphere of influence would give nukes to a country that is at war and in danger of annexation by Russia."

UAO collects military artifacts provided by Ukrainian soldiers and works with local artists in Ukraine to incorporate them into art. Our objective is to convert remnants of conflict into artwork with the idea of art defeating the aggressor's evil. The produced artwork will be auctioned and proceeds will be used to equip the Ukrainian Armed Forces. Since the start of the war, there have been many art-related fundraising initiatives, but what makes this one unique is that we seek to incorporate destroyed military artifacts. By doing this, artwork will serve as a scribe and a reminder of Russian atrocities inflicted on Ukraine.

"A 20-year-old Ukrainian from Donbass blew up Lenin's ass in 2009, before it became mainstream(Full story in comments)","We were discussing how young Ukrainians feel about the Soviet era, and my wife—who's from Rubizhne in Donbas—showed me a photo with an intriguing story. Back in 2009, a 20-year-old rescue diver from her hometown blew up Lenin's ass, and the incident made headlines everywhere.Curious, I dug up some old news articles from that time.On the night of April 3rd, the young man rode his bike to the Lenin monument. He inserted a homemade explosive device into the statue's ass, secured it with plasticine, lit the fuse, and sped away.He had crafted the explosive himself using a brass tube and an explosive mix taken from a World War II mine he'd found in a forest a year earlier. His training as a rescue diver likely helped him safely handle and repurpose the old mine.The next day, local communists noticed the damage to Lenin's statue. They organized an urgent gathering, exclaiming, ""Lenin's birthday is in two weeks, and his ass is blown up! We can't celebrate his birthday like this!""The story quickly spread from local newspapers to television.Our 20-year-old hero was amazed by the impact of his actions. After all, he had:* Blown up Lenin’s ass* Disrupted the communists' gathering for their leader's birthday* Made it onto TVBut here's the twist: he started bragging about it feat everywhere, and was eventually caught.This was the first Lenin statue taken down in Donbas, and it was a bold move even then. In the same year, on July 30th in Kyiv, Ukrainian activists broke Lenin's nose and knocked off his arm. In 2013, those activists were jailed for two years.The 2009 incident in Rubizhne didn't have a public political motive, so I hope they didn't imprison the diver.I tried to find out what eventually happened to him, but Rubizhne is now destroyed and occupied by Russia. By the way, Lenin's statue was never restored. According to some, the funds raised for repairs were stolen by the communists themselves, and the statue was dismantled and hidden away.For more stories about life during the war in Ukraine, you can check out  [Max Pass - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@max_pass/featured)"

All Good Generals want to have a heart. All Good Generals feel pain every single time they send someone to die.   There is no way to express the duality between having to do it and the knowledge that you are going to cut some of these peoples lives short.  You are going to change them. You are going to effectively torture them and give them PTSD and nightmares. You as the General are responsible for every single thing that happens to them even if the reason you do that is to protect everyone else and the cause of your actions is being forced by bloodthirsty savages. There unfortunately has to be a point when you respect and honour what the people dying are doing more than your desire to see them survive. To respect and honour them so much that you will do everything in your power to make the correct calls and the best plans so fewer of them have to pay the price for what you *must* do."

"EU set to renew training mission for Ukrainian soldiers through 2026","From Semafor's Mathias Hammer:The European Union is expected to renew its training mission for Ukrainian troops through 2026, officials said. The program, established shortly after Russia’s 2022 invasion of Ukraine, has trained more than 60,000 soldiers so far.The mission has been one of the bloc’s flagship initiatives for supporting Ukraine: At facilities across the continent, European armies have drilled Ukrainian soldiers in everything from basic training to the use of advanced, Western-provided weapons. Ukrainian officials have requested that the program — which is currently set to expire towards the end of this year— be continued.“Member states have agreed… to extend for another two years,” Colonel Niels Janeke, chief of staff for the mission’s Special Training Command, told Semafor. There is a “consensus by all member states,” Janeke added, even if a final decision has yet to be made by the European Council. “Our intent is to offer training slots as we did in 2024, but it fully depends on the Ukrainian requirements.”Lieutenant Colonel Roland Bösker of the Special Training Command told Semafor that training plans had already been prepared for 2025 and 2026.A European official, requesting anonymity to discuss ongoing negotiations, said EU member states were “in the final stretches,” but warned that reaching an agreement could be complicated because of “one usual suspect,” a reference to Hungary, which has consistently slowed down European efforts to support Kyiv. “It’s just a question of what is the price we have to pay.”[Read the full story here.](https://www.semafor.com/article/10/10/2024/eu-set-to-renew-training-mission-for-ukrainian-soldiers?utm_campaign=semaforreddit)"

"When having a conversation with “not all Russians bad, I’m just for peace” Westerner remember these words by Friedrich Nietzche","Just look at how the Biden administration has “helped” Ukraine. Everyone knows what is happening, thousand of women and children are killed in a country that just wanted t beleg alone. They never attacked Russia or wanted any part of it. Everyone knows what will happen if Putin gets the country, oppression, rape, torture, murder on a great scale. Everyone knows that once getting Ukraine Putin can’t stop. Even after tremendous loses he doesn’t stop. Yet Obama, out of fear, denied help after 2014. Trump denied help out of principle. Than  Biden continued Obamas policy of appeasement to this day. He purposely protects the Russia by denying Ukraine long range weapons and aircraft. The 10 (!) F16 they have are old Belgian and Dutch aircraft, not a single aircraft was delivered from the U.S. - but he did send 30 old M1 tanks. Russia has thousands of aircraft and tanks. Without air superiority Americans would never even fight a war.This is by far the biggest war since WWII with a clear villain and a victim. And the U.S. that was promising to protect this country they boated into disarming is just pretending to help. Ukraine can’t even use any of the U.S. old weapons to hit the archer, they are limited to intercept the arrows? Ukrainians don’t target Russian apartments in Moscow, they don’t take civilians in Kursk hostage and torture them. But they have to suffer Bucha, Irpin etc. where civilians were raped tortured and murdered. Thousand of their woman and children are killed intentionally by Russian missiles, drones and bombs-to the cheers of Russian TV and bloggers. Russia threatens Western nations across the world with Armageddon on a weekly basis. The Russian President openly uses nuclear blackmail to convince the West what it can and can’t do. Funny thing is, no Western (NATO) forces fight in Ukraine or Russia but Russian forces are in Ukraine. And Biden giving in to nuclear blackmail is already destabilizing the world. Let’s not even get to what Trump is going to do to the world."

We've certainly seen quite a few arson attacks against Russian infrastructure. Those are more visible. But there are a lot of potential acts of resistance that won't be so visible.

"Losses of the Russian military to 10.10.2024","On the front lines, the Russian army’s offensive continued in the same directions.- In the Kursk region, Russian sources report that the Russian army has gained control over two settlements, but there has been no confirmation of this. Battles are ongoing at several points, but the Russian army has not yet managed to launch a major offensive.- In the northern part of Vovchansk in the Kharkiv direction, battles continue and there have been no significant changes in the situation.- A very active offensive continues towards the cities of Kupiansk and Lyman. Yesterday, the Russian army was not able to make significant progress. Social media channels reported advancements by Russian units in the Siversk direction yesterday. However, there has been no confirmation of this, and according to Ukrainian sources, it was relatively quiet in this sector.- In the Bahmut area, the pressure continues towards Chasiv Yar, but Russian units have not managed to improve their positions. Serious urban battles continue on the southern and eastern edges of Toretsk city. Since predominantly small infantry units operate in the grey zone of the front line, the situation in this limited area is very fluid. The Russian army has not achieved any major advancements.- On the Pokrovsk city direction, the pressure from Russian units slightly increased yesterday, but they only managed marginal improvements in their positions. The most severe attacks are continuing southwest of Donetsk, where Russian units have managed to move forward slightly in some points.- On the southern front, Russian units conducted a few reconnaissance battles and were generally passive. The local Ukrainian military command continues active communication, indicating that Russian units are preparing for a larger offensive in this area."

"Shipping Gifts to Ukraine","As a better alternative to the regular mail, I would suggest using Meest. They have agents / franchisees all over the country. Their rates are much lower and they know how to handle customs related questions like yours along the route. We shipped dozens of boxes to our family in Ukraine over the years and never once had any issues. Even the packages we shipped in Jan 2022 made it to our parents to our great surprise, though with a 2 months delay. Their air shipments usually make it there in 2 to 4 weeks, ground mode takes much longer, 6 to 7 weeks. The two local franchisees also collect and ship there humanitarian aid packages.Sending packages using regular mail has proven to be less reliable in my practice. A small package with souvenirs we sent from the UK last Dec to our friends in Kyiv never made it, though its tracking status said “Delivered”. Post cards and regular letters usually make it, though delivery times vary wildly. We had a high school student from Ukraine with us in 2022-2023, she likes exchanging postcards with friends she made here and with us just for the fun of it.I heard a Ukrainian carrier Nova Poshta (Nova Post) - super popular in Ukraine - also has presence / agents on the East Coast, but as a Californian I have not looked into it.Hope this helps :)"
"Shipping Gifts to Ukraine","Can't tell for US. But sending from germany via dhl we just fill the customs declaration and thats it.

Even more infuriating when Ruzzian missiles have U.S. electronic components and are indiscriminately fired at Ukrainian civilian locations, but god forbid Western missiles are used as intended 🙄In any case, super excited for Ukraine to have produced their own homemade missiles and drones so they don’t have to listen to anyone else’s demands on how the weapons are used.

I'm not attacking you here. Loss and grief do a number on all of us, often causing us to make rash, ill-considered moves. That's what you're doing right now.Please do not jump into volunteering in Ukraine. Ukraine is inundated with people who are looking to give their lives meaning. To put it bluntly, that is not what Ukraine needs. Going over out of a need to give your own life meaning is *self*\-serving.Unless you have some familiarity with the language, some combat/emergency medical training, and the ability to keep your head in a crisis, in an emergency, you're just going to be an extra headache for someone in a country whose people and resources are already strained to the breaking point.As other people have pointed out, you can do far more good for Ukraine by staying home and donating to the charities who are operating there. They need money more than they need another unskilled foreigner on the ground.If you really want to give your life meaning and be a hero, *do what Ukraine needs*, not what you need Ukraine to do for you. It's not about you. It's about the country fighting a war of erasure."

I was hoping for useful information, links, suggestions so I could build up as much information as possible and make an informed decision.I have already been speaking charities inside Ukraine and what they say differs wildly from any advice here. Even in Kharkiv where there is a 5:30 curfew and air raid warnings they take volunteers all the time, shops are open and they have contactless (tap to pay) payment. They need more people to build drones and bake thousands of meals and loaves of bread a day.Basically, what I'm hearing from those who are actually doing it seems completely contrary to the advice on this forum."

The allies also need to take off the kid gloves and allow for Ukraine to target airfields and other bases that Russia uses to launch these long range strikes on civilian infrastructure, and power plants, etc. The sooner we allow the to fight and protect themselves without hands tied behind their back, the sooner Russia will fall due to a failing wartime economy and massive sanctions, massive losses on the front line etc, and the sooner this straight up war crime of an invasion can be stopped and we can help them rebuild and arm for protection, nato membership, hopefully some war crime trials and the start of healing and getting life as it should be and not what it is right now.

"Nataliya Bugayova Explains How Ukraine Can Still Win","Of course Ukraine can still win.If her allies let her."
"Nataliya Bugayova Explains How Ukraine Can Still Win","On the *Secrets of Statecraft* podcast, [Andrew Roberts](https://hoover.us1.list-manage.com/track/click?u=de744b88c98cf7f8a268b1808&id=76c732ab2b&e=922d029bee) speaks with Institute for the Study of War fellow Nataliya Bugayova about where the Russo-Ukrainian War goes from here. As Ukraine has nimbly crafted a new defense industrial base, it has to decide whether to end hostilities now and “settle for a temporary respite” that may lead to a new war with Russia in the future or press hard for a victory that could ensure a lasting peace.She also stresses that ""Russia is not invulnerable. And while it certainly has several key advantages that are well discussed, it has several vulnerabilities as well. First and foremost, it's inability to rapidly pivot, even though with time it always is able to adjust. Russia is also accumulating, and Putin himself is accumulating a number of risk a number of fronts, including domestic stability and the economy and the fundamentals of Russian defense industrial base.""As Bugayova explains, the ""real choice that we're really facing is either to invest in countering the Russian challenge in Ukraine and against the west in a way that results in a durable peace. Or settle for temporary respite that will have us facing the same problem with much higher escalation risk and costs down the road."""
"Nataliya Bugayova Explains How Ukraine Can Still Win","Russia needs to collapse. For the good of the world, Ukraine, and even Russia. Ukraine winning on the battlefield would be incredibly costly for Ukraine. Going on the attack everywhere, to take back all the territory? Horrifically costly.Ukraine stopping before getting all their territory back would be costly and tragic in the long run. Putin would take it as a win, and Russia might stay together and rebuild until they could attack stronger, like they did in Chechnya and Georgia.Ukraine holding out until Russia exhausts itself and collapses may be the best possible outcome, even though it is heartbreaking, tragic, and frustrating as hell while it's happening."
"Nataliya Bugayova Explains How Ukraine Can Still Win","Ukraine Is winning. The russians are rapidly running out of everything \[yeah, yeah, I know you've heard that from the beginning of the war and it Is true, russia just had 1000s of everything. They are down to hundreds of everything\] The strikes on oil depots, refineries and ammo depots will cripple both the ecomomy and ability to wage war of the russians.The West hasn't given Ukraine the weapons that would end the war quickly for two reasons, one, doing that means an escalation that would end up with their people dying on the battlefield, which they don't want. and Two, they  want the russian war machine completely dismantled. Ukraine is grinding the russians into dust-sometime next year, maybe even this year, russia won't have enough artillery to effectively wage war, for example.There are billions of dollar of aid and material promised to the Ukrainians- next year, for example, they'll have dozens of fighter jets delivered to them. Ukraine is going to have thousands of land based drones with machine guns next year, the russians will have to go through multiple layers of weaponry before they can effectively attack actual troops. The russians are fubared they will collapse at some point, the only hope they have is that Ukraine collapses before the russians  do. Won't happen."
"Nataliya Bugayova Explains How Ukraine Can Still Win","Unfortunately, even if Kamala wins the election, US arms shipments will merely remain at the same level. There is zero appetite in the American political system to increase aid levels. Big European allies are no better. Germany is cutting aid budgets.And this is the best case scenario.I just don't see how Ukraine can achieve victory with current aid levels. There would have to be a massive increase in arms supplies to substantially change the war in Ukraine's favour."
"Losses of the Russian military to 9.10.2024","On the front lines, the Russian army’s offensive continued in the same directions.- In the Kursk region, Russian sources report that the Russian army has gained control over two settlements, but there has been no confirmation of this. Battles are ongoing at several points, but the Russian army has not yet managed to launch a major offensive.- In the northern part of Vovchansk in the Kharkiv direction, battles continue and there have been no significant changes in the situation.- A very active offensive continues towards the cities of Kupiansk and Lyman. Yesterday, the Russian army was not able to make significant progress. Social media channels reported advancements by Russian units in the Siversk direction yesterday. However, there has been no confirmation of this, and according to Ukrainian sources, it was relatively quiet in this sector.- In the Bahmut area, the pressure continues towards Chasiv Yar, but Russian units have not managed to improve their positions. Serious urban battles continue on the southern and eastern edges of Toretsk city. Since predominantly small infantry units operate in the grey zone of the front line, the situation in this limited area is very fluid. The Russian army has not achieved any major advancements.- On the Pokrovsk city direction, the pressure from Russian units slightly increased yesterday, but they only managed marginal improvements in their positions. The most severe attacks are continuing southwest of Donetsk, where Russian units have managed to move forward slightly in some points.- On the southern front, Russian units conducted a few reconnaissance battles and were generally passive. The local Ukrainian military command continues active communication, indicating that Russian units are preparing for a larger offensive in this area."

"A savory dish of Ukrainian folk-style chicken Kholodets, served cold with Tsvikli and Polish brown mustard","On my day off, I decided to finally prepare the folk-style natural Kholodets with a whole chicken and pig feet for gelatinous goodness. I added diced carrots, scallions, and thyme to the finished broth before setting up in the fridge overnight. Garnished with onion and scallion brushes and dill. I served with homemade tsvikli - grated beetroot and horseradish condiment - and some sweet and slightly hot brown mustard from Poland (Staropolska.)It took some time to prepare, but most of it is just soaking and simmering time, so it doesn't take much continuous attention. By quickly boiling the meat initially, then rinsing and adding fresh water to simmer, almost all the foam comes out in the first step and there is very little skimming to do during the longer 4 hour simmering phase.Try this tasty, jiggly and delicious dish! It is savory and unctuous without any hint of fattiness at all - it simply melts in your mouth and leaves you asking, ""where have you been all my life, my dear?"" I based my Kholodets on Chef Klopotenko's version with a few minor adjustments.

"As Feodosia Fire Rages for Third Day After Ukrainian Strike, Fuel Shortages Loom in Occupied Crimea","As Russian oil refineries and depots get burned up lets remember how fucking useless Russia's ""allies"" are. Iran is a worthless trading partner, since it's also a petrostate. There's basically nothing that Iran can provide Russia that Russia doesn't have and vice versa. Not to mention, Israel's escalatory actions may force Iran to stop supplying Russia with weaponry. China, on the other hand, dominates the Russian automobile market with cheap EVs, which reduce demand for Russian oil and gas *within their own borders*. All while domestically fuel prices are rising (for obvious reasons). The Russian economy, despite being heavily sanctioned has done very little to diversify its economy from oil and gas. China and India consistently buy Russian gas at discounted rates, and for far cheaper what the EU countries would buy it for before the full scale invasion.All of this while Russia faces high inflation and has to set the national interest rate at 19%"

The press shouldn't be bullied, especially in war."
"Ukrainska Pravda reports systematic pressure from the Office of the President of Ukraine","Good, keep publicly documenting what is going on like this, as is expected in a free society.I mean, yes, there will be pressures like this.  The need for the state to discipline discourse in the interest of survival during wartime, versus the need for the press to report the truth.  Two equally important needs that cannot always be reconciled.  This tension does not go away.  It cannot be made to go away.Except of course once Ukraine wins the war, at last.Just as an example in kind, during the Second World War, the press of my country, the USA, was collectively briefed on the Allied landings at Normandy when the first planes took off -- it was the very early morning hours in Europe but the afternoon of the day prior in America -- but then locked in the briefing room for hours under armed guard until it was too late to print the story for the evening newspapers.This was not very nice of the government, and the reporters all complained.  But the military officials knew that the reporters had a duty to report what they knew as soon as they were able, and rather than censor them outright they chose to simply delay them.Should they have done this?   Shouldn't they have?  It is a vexing question.My point is not to take a side on the question, merely to point out that it is a constant tension, not only in Ukraine in the present war."

"“We have to help each other”: the story of a woman from Kherson who survived the occupation and continues helping under fire | UACRISIS.ORG","Our Aid group was one of the first civilian vehicles into Kherson when it was liberated in  November 2022,the huge display of jubilation & national pride was overwhelming ,so it has always held a special part in my conscience . We deliver Aid & materials to the front line units there at least twice a year,l got back from our last Aid convoy which included 2 days in Kherson in late August .It has been in the news lately with the orc drones stepping up their deliberate strikes on civilians ,but the reality is they have now been targeting the civilians for years . The orcs never destroyed Kherson when they were fighting to capture it, as obviously they wanted the civilians on side & facilities they could utilize & steal valuables from  relatively intact . Since Kherson was recaptured in  November 2022 the orcs have blatantly targeted civilians & the town's essential infrastructure to demoralize the population & hope it rises up against the Ukrainian govt. They have targeted & destroyed /damaged systematically the power & water infrastructure, ,Hospitals ,even small health centers for the elderly ,schools ,kindergartens,food & water retailers,churches where the elderly gather etc ,etc . The orcs are now targeting individual community leaders/helpers who due to the above travel around Kherson delivering essentials like food ,water & medicines to the elderly & infirm who can not now leave their houses.  Just a day ago we  were  informed that the Community Activist our Aid group used & spent days travelling in the vehicles together & living with on the road   ,was one of the women injured in the latest cowardly glide bomb attack on the schools in Kherson . ( On our Aid missions we also employ local women to act as what is known as Community Activists ,(CA),they are known to the locals & very effective to rally the people for evacuation . More importantly in newly liberated areas they can get women to talk about whether they have been raped or assaulted while under occupation ,when they will not normally talk to male officials & enables them to get the medical attention & help they need. All the CA we have used over the years are always really intelligent ,kind & strong women .) Her family had already lost 2 members in fighting & her nephew we used as a guide on this trip was 6 months into  recovering from shrapnel & life changing wounds & now she may never walk without crutches again.Not all heroes get medals - ""A hero is someone who understands the responsibility that comes with their  freedom."""

Corruption, and LGBT+ rights come to mind.Let there be no room for doubt that they have made phenomenal strides in rising to the standards of the EU, which is even more impressive in the context of doing so in the midst of their fight for survival and identity.

"Losses of the Russian military to 8.10.2024","On the front lines, the Russian army’s offensive continued in the same directions.- In the Kursk region, Russian sources report that the Russian army has gained control over two settlements, but there has been no confirmation of this. Battles are ongoing at several points, but the Russian army has not yet managed to launch a major offensive.- In the northern part of Vovchansk in the Kharkiv direction, battles continue and there have been no significant changes in the situation.- A very active offensive continues towards the cities of Kupiansk and Lyman. Yesterday, the Russian army was not able to make significant progress. Social media channels reported advancements by Russian units in the Siversk direction yesterday. However, there has been no confirmation of this, and according to Ukrainian sources, it was relatively quiet in this sector.- In the Bahmut area, the pressure continues towards Chasiv Yar, but Russian units have not managed to improve their positions. Serious urban battles continue on the southern and eastern edges of Toretsk city. Since predominantly small infantry units operate in the grey zone of the front line, the situation in this limited area is very fluid. The Russian army has not achieved any major advancements.- On the Pokrovsk city direction, the pressure from Russian units slightly increased yesterday, but they only managed marginal improvements in their positions. The most severe attacks are continuing southwest of Donetsk, where Russian units have managed to move forward slightly in some points.- On the southern front, Russian units conducted a few reconnaissance battles and were generally passive. The local Ukrainian military command continues active communication, indicating that Russian units are preparing for a larger offensive in this area."

"Ukrainian Music For Celebration","If you want something classical (and classy), you can't go wrong with anything written by Mykola Lysenko, and he's written stuff in a variety of styles you can choose from depending on the mood you're after. Plus, he's a key figure in Ukrainian musical history, who was focused on defining Ukrainian musical identity, so I think it's a good symbolic choice if you're looking for that.Outside of classical, I think you might need to be a bit more specific about what genre or style you're looking for: Ukrainian music is pretty diverse, so this is about as open-ended as asking for music suggestions for any western country.Also, I'm not Ukrainian, to be fair, so if there's something more common to play when celebrating someone's achievements, I'm not going to know about it."

On this trip our guide was recovering from shrapnel wounds & a bad Blast Lung Injury,(BLI), that nearly killed him &  would stop him from being able to do manual work again & he was looking at becoming a taxi/bus driver. We also employ women to act as what is known as Community Activists ,(CA),they are known to the locals & very effective to rally the people for evacuation . More importantly in newly liberated areas they can get women to talk about whether they have been raped or assaulted while under occupation ,when they will not normally talk to male officials & enables them to get the medical attention & help they need. All the CA we have used over the years are always really kind & strong women . On this trip the wounded guide & CA were related, she was his Aunty,so we had a lot of laughs as they told stories of each other's life .We were just informed that the Community Activist was one of the women injured in this cowardly attack. Her family had already lost 2 members in fighting & the nephew recovering from shrapnel & life changing wounds & now she may never walk without crutches again."

People were leaping up and down in their places and shouting at the tops of their voices in an effort to drown the maddening bleating voice that came from the screen. The little sandy-haired woman had turned bright pink, and her mouth was opening and shutting like that of a landed fish. Even O’Brien’s heavy face was flushed. He was sitting very straight in his chair, his powerful chest swelling and quivering as though he were standing up to the assault of a wave. The dark-haired girl behind Winston had begun crying out ‘Swine! Swine! Swine!’ and suddenly she picked up a heavy Newspeak dictionary and flung it at the screen. It struck Goldstein’s nose and bounced off; the voice continued inexorably. **In a lucid moment Winston found that he was shouting with the others and kicking his heel violently against the rung of his chair. The horrible thing about the Two Minutes Hate was not that one was obliged to act a part, but, on the contrary, that it was impossible to avoid joining in.** Within thirty seconds any pretence was always unnecessary. A hideous ecstasy of fear and vindictiveness, a desire to kill, to torture, to smash faces in with a sledge-hammer, seemed to flow through the whole group of people like an electric current, turning one even against one’s will into a grimacing, screaming lunatic. And yet the rage that one felt was an abstract, undirected emotion which could be switched from one object to another like the flame of a blowlamp.""  from *Nineteen Eighty-Four* by George Orwell"

"2 teenagers attacked and injured by Russian drones in Kherson by banned ""Petal"" anti-infantry mines","When we were doing an Aid mission to the front lines in the region in late August,the orcs had developed a Mavic type drone that dropped these out of a modified cluster bomb canister . I have mentioned previously that the Dragon Drones are not new & have been used for nearly a year now,the orcs using these ""Butterfly/Green Parrot "" soviet mines to booby trap the surrounds & the actual inside of orc trench systems is one of the reasons those drones are being used as the UAF took a lot of casualties to begin with from these tactics . Due to area l was first deployed to in the mountains of Afghanistan ie Tora Bora & on the Pakistan/Afghan border regions ,we received additional training on the danger of these PFM-1 and PFM-1S ""Butterfly/Green Parrot "" soviet mines . During the soviet–Afghan War the Orc's would use these to cover huge areas with them as  area denial while they retreated ,exactly what they are doing now in Ukraine . The  irregular shape means they  blend in perfectly with foliage, so during  autumn they blend in & disappear among   fallen leaves  . Unfortunately due to their shape they attract children & the curious  to tamper with them, with terrible results . Even if civilians or the plain dumb throw objects at them, they can still injure with shrapnel from the thrown object or surface they were on even simple rocks,a UAF member suffered a punctured lung from a rock thrown up by one of these when he hit it with a long stick while it was on a village dirt road  . The EOD technicians l saw dealing with these  in Afghanistan used a specially made, long handled, plastic type spatula/paddle designed to remove them ,so the plastic disintegrates to lessen shrapnel  if they go off under their own weight or shot them from a distance . In Afghanistan, we would see old men & women who were kids during the soviet war  were victims of these from picking them up out of children's curiosity . They were called 'Crab People' as if these mines  go off when you pick them up ,(just the pressure of  being lifted under their own weight can set them off) ,they will take a tennis ball size hole out of your hand often leaving just a thumb  leaving it look like a crab claw & the same with your foot if you just stepped on the edge ,a full force step on one can take the foot & ankle off ,so more destructive than the old toe poppers. But when used in urban areas with lots of hard concrete/roads etc, these can go off just like a cluster bomb injuring those nearby . The orcs have attacked cities & towns with these for years now."
"2 teenagers attacked and injured by Russian drones in Kherson by banned ""Petal"" anti-infantry mines","I'm not a fan of cluster munitions. I'm certainly not a fan of cluster mine munitions. American-Made cluster munitions may have a failure rate of 5% and often have dual failsafe systems like mechanical AND chemical timers. Rendering the failed munition inert and incapable of arming.These Soviet designed butterfly mines are the actual cluster munitions people should be worrying about. They're made to have these mines sit and occupy an area. They have a failure rate of 15% to 40%. Meaning a cluster shell could have almost half of the mines still active beyond their deactivation timer. They have incredibly unreliable deactivation timers and can sit indefinitely, armed and ready. Another scary thing is they're hollow and plastic. Any amount of rain can carry them off and deposit it somewhere to wait for an unsuspecting victim. Lastly, detonation pressure. It takes about 5kg to set off the trigger. In comparison, that's about a 1 gallon water jug. But with degradation and no secondary failsafe, they can detonate at random. Say you're a kid jumping in a puddle. These things barely have enough explosive to take off a foot or better part of a leg. That's it. They're designed to maim, not kill. They're fucking cruel. And the fuckers deploying them are absolutely fucking evil."

The cargo supposedly traveled through 2000+ kilometers of Russian territory to get there.Since last spring, the Russian border has been closed entirely for people, and cargo traffic is minimal (Putin's regime kept trafficking migrant people from the Middle East to the border and the Finnish government eventually closed it). The Finnish customs keeps a very close eye on sanctioned goods, but for the stuff that is not sanctioned, there's not much they can do if the exporter actually manages to get a transport across the border.

The way it works is that each company is responsible for the end customer of their products. Its not who you sell it to but who the end customer is. You have to sign agreements with your customers that they may not resell the equipment in to Russia. If your products end up in Russia anyway you as a company has to prove that you did your due diligence or face fines, that is how its explained to me at least. Most large companies takes this very seriously but I have heard so many stories about smaller resellers actively working to circumvent the sanctions because its very lucrative or people hired by Russia to import critical components from the European markets so they setup elaborate schemes to trick suppliers."
"EU countries’ exports to Kyrgyzstan","Well, there’s no sanctions on Kyrgyzstan and we live in capitalism. What did you expect?"
"EU countries’ exports to Kyrgyzstan","Those exports went from absolutely nothing to basically nothing.German exports are roughly 1,6 trillion a yearGerman exports to russia went down from 50 billion pre 2014 invasion to 32 billion in '21 to just under 10 billion '23. Sanctions are air tight, but they do work"

"EU countries’ exports to Kyrgyzstan","This is nothing but greed. The governments of these countries have to know where these products are ending up. They need to have the guts to sanction any country that is acting as a pass-through. Even Turkey."

"EU countries’ exports to Kyrgyzstan","As an Austrian, I don’t really get bent out of shape by that “revelation”.Even if all 8 million of those $ were somehow purely sanction evading products (which they obviously aren’t, because half of that money flow already existed into Krygystan in 2013 before any invasion) that’s such a tiny amount of money, it’s trivial in the context of this war."
"EU countries’ exports to Kyrgyzstan","A disgrace for Europe and for every European company participating in that."
"EU countries’ exports to Kyrgyzstan","There's an explanation besides sanctions evasion: Before the invasion companies often used their Russian subsidiaries to handle trade with countries from the former Soviet Union. After these subsidiaries shut down, the trade now goes directly to these countries instead of going through Russia. That accounts for a significant part of the observed increase.That doesn't mean sanctions evasion isn't real, but it's a little bit more nuanced."
"EU countries’ exports to Kyrgyzstan","So even if this is true - what happens is this increases the cost for Russia who now has to use a middleman so the sanctions still work"

We could end this so so fast. I’m 100% sure that yes we help Ukraine so our beautiful EU buildings will be safe in the future but… I think the fucking west is sucking the life out of Ukraine. Bro give them a nuke and say get out or Moskow is gone.. wtf are we playing here I am really like 10 days away of saying the west wants to bleed both Ukraine and Russia and we are just the bad guys with different camo…."

"Russia’s S-70 Hunter Drone Was Armed When Shot Down By Friendly Fighter Over Ukraine. Evidence from the crash site points to the flying wing drone having flown a combat test mission with glide bombs.","Ok so I've been thinking about designs for drones to drop other drones and glide bombs, and here we see that idea being used by RF. Why a 'stealth' drone?So as there has been attacks on Russian air bases by long range drones, the aircraft dropping glide bombs have pulled back, further from the target. Already, Russia has developed an upgraded glide kit with larger wing span and so increased glide ratio, so it can fly further, but at slower speed.To get the launch vehicle closer they have developed a stealth drone whose only job is to get the glide bomb high enough, with some forward velocity. No hard specs exist on the top speed but it's thought to be around 1000kmph, and it uses a very powerful and overengineered engine which is able to afterburn and operate supersonicly, which is not needed here.A less powerful higher bypass engine, such as a business jet turbo fan, should be possible to add to Ukraines own version of this at lower cost.This design wouldn't have much need for the power in that engine, it's trading top speed for range. It seems these will be operated from well back away from the front, the stealth is just to get close without a high chance of detection.Another photo of the wreckage shows it seems to be using something like wood screws to attach upper surfaces to the frame.If I was Ukraine, I would be looking to build several of these to dump gliding munitions and drones on the enemy.Reducing RCS may be possible with carbon composites enriched with various carbon additives, such as carbon black.A manufacturing technique exists to reduce carbon fibre manufacturing costs, it uses a hot liquid solution to transfer heat to the composite curing it in minutes rather than hours. It was developed by UMIST and patent sold to BMW, which may be lapsed, but no one needs to know how Ukraine is making these things.A top speed of 1000kmph is not necessary, 600 to 700 may be more than adequate, thus the drag is greatly reduced, and the engine power requirement and fuel burn much less, so fuel and engine mass is greatly reduced, increasing payload or translating to an even stealthier, smaller plane."

"Dear Reddit community, on Saturday we collected vegetables for the military in neighbouring villages to provide food for the soldiers! Thank you to everyone who responded and donated fuel for their transport!!!","Dear Reddit community, on Saturday morning I asked for your help to buy fuel to pick vegetables. Immediately after I made the post, the boys and I went to the neighbouring villages. I hadn't been there since last spring (we were picking vegetables for the people of Kherson region) and since then the communication situation there has deteriorated a lot, I have two mobile phone operators but no internet, only poor connection. We were on the road all day because we had to deliver these vegetables to a volunteer centre in a neighbouring town. Since I hadn't managed to raise the money to buy the drone on Friday, I didn't really count on fuel this time either. In addition, I couldn't check all the time whether we had enough money in the account, so I asked a local businessman for support with fuel. So I checked the account only in the evening. I was shocked to see that we had raised about $650 instead of $150. I decided to make a general post thanking everyone who joined in, but due to a bad connection, this post was not published. Then I decided to try again, but by this time Shahed had hit the electricity substation that serves my village. I was really hoping that nothing bad would happen if I didn't stop collecting, because news feeds change quickly. And so, during yesterday, another $110 was added. Today I came to work and spent the whole day trying to publish the report. Reddit didn't want to upload it because it was a lot of fhoto, and I simply didn't have time to make personalised thank you notes. So why did I write this huge text?  Only to say that I was saving $150 for fuel, and it turned out to be $760, of which I did not spend anything for the intended purpose. Do I regret that it happened? To be honest, no, because I always have a queue with the needs of the military, and I will report you how I'll spend them. I would just like to say that I am extremely impressed with your support. I did not expect to receive such an amount, because every month it is more and more difficult to close the collection. I want to say extremely grateful for Koen (happy birthday Julian !!!) , Martin, Pamela, Jeremy, Olaf, James Travis, Ian, Esther, Alex Joni, Lauri, who support us on Sunday, Riley, The Tonic, and Maxime and of course to Kent (but I think it's amount for any needs, not for fuel:)The whole world is tired of the war in Ukraine and the need to support us. In Ukraine itself, the population has become very poor over the past three years, many people have gone abroad, many have been killed, many are at war, and it turns out that the collections are much slower than before. In addition, there is a crop failure in my region. There has been a drought for the last two months. This does not mean that people have nothing to eat, it just means that they have nothing to share. So, based on previous years, I ordered a truck for 20 tonnes, but we collected less than 7 tonnes, and this is despite the fact that we visited more villages. That is, if people used to give extra, now they just share what they have. Perhaps I have been unable to write to you for so long that I am writing more than necessary, but I simply do not know how else to express my gratitude. I want to give you all a big hug :)"

"Russian guided bombs target school in Kherson, injuring 18 civilians -","I am part of a private aid group that supplies front line units in Ukraine ,we just did an aid convoy in late August & among other regions we delivered aid to was Kherson. When we do convoys we use  soldiers recovering from their injuries from the TDF as our guides ,to try to give them some additional funds for their families & give them some work to get them out of their houses . We also employ women to act as what is known as  Community Activists ,(CA),they are known to the locals & very effective  to rally the people for evacuation  . More importantly in newly liberated areas they can get women to talk about whether they have been raped or assaulted while under occupation ,when they will not normally talk to male officials & enables them to get the medical attention & help they need. All the CA we have used over the years   are   always really kind & strong women . On this trip the wounded guide & CA were related, she was his Aunty,so we had a lot of laughs as they told stories of each other's life .  We were just informed that the  Community Activist was one of the women injured in this cowardly attack.

"Losses of the Russian military to 7.10.2024","On the front lines, the Russian army’s offensive continued in the same directions.- In the Kursk region, Russian sources report that the Russian army has gained control over two settlements, but there has been no confirmation of this. Battles are ongoing at several points, but the Russian army has not yet managed to launch a major offensive.- In the northern part of Vovchansk in the Kharkiv direction, battles continue and there have been no significant changes in the situation.- A very active offensive continues towards the cities of Kupiansk and Lyman. Yesterday, the Russian army was not able to make significant progress. Social media channels reported advancements by Russian units in the Siversk direction yesterday. However, there has been no confirmation of this, and according to Ukrainian sources, it was relatively quiet in this sector.- In the Bahmut area, the pressure continues towards Chasiv Yar, but Russian units have not managed to improve their positions. Serious urban battles continue on the southern and eastern edges of Toretsk city. Since predominantly small infantry units operate in the grey zone of the front line, the situation in this limited area is very fluid. The Russian army has not achieved any major advancements.- On the Pokrovsk city direction, the pressure from Russian units slightly increased yesterday, but they only managed marginal improvements in their positions. The most severe attacks are continuing southwest of Donetsk, where Russian units have managed to move forward slightly in some points.- On the southern front, Russian units conducted a few reconnaissance battles and were generally passive. The local Ukrainian military command continues active communication, indicating that Russian units are preparing for a larger offensive in this area."

"Fico and Šmyhaľ met near Užgorod: Slovakia unconditionally supports Ukraine's entry into the EU","Translation:Fico and Šmyhaľ met near Uzhgorod: Slovakia unconditionally supports Ukraine's entry into the EUUkrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhaľ said that during a bilateral meeting with his Slovak counterpart Robert Fico, he discussed the development of cooperation between the two countries, Slovak support for the Ukrainian peace plan and the path of the country, which has been resisting Russian aggression for the third year, to the European Union. The second Ukrainian-Slovak intergovernmental consultations were held in the west of Ukraine. The Ukrainian Prime Minister hopes that eight joint documents will be signed by the end of this year.  The Slovak government is interested in continuing similar intergovernmental consultations with Ukraine. Therefore, he invites the Ukrainian government to another joint meeting, which would take place in January or February next year. Prime Minister Robert Fico (Smer) informed about this after the end of joint negotiations with Ukraine near Uzhgorod.At the same time, the Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic supports every plan to guarantee peace in Ukraine. ""If there should be meetings at a lower level as part of the big peace summit, which is to be held at some point, perhaps at the level where sub-parameters of the big summit need to be discussed, I offer Slovakian hospitality,"" said Fico. According to him, Slovakia would spare no resources or energy on such an occasion and will do everything to make the eventual conference as successful as possible.    After a joint meeting, the ministers of the interior, education and agriculture of the Slovak and Ukrainian governments signed joint memoranda. It was an agreement to implement the readmission agreement. Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhaľ explained that it is about improving the algorithm of driving Ukrainians home. Furthermore, according to Šmyhaľ, they signed a memorandum on mutual understanding between Ukraine and Slovakia, which provides for the support of Ukrainian students and teachers in Slovakia. It also talks about direct cooperation between educational institutions in innovative activities. Ministers of agriculture signed a memorandum of cooperation. ""We expect support in Ukraine's European integration, especially with regard to our legislation on European standards,"" added Šmyhaľ.    Before the negotiations of the joint Ukrainian-Slovak government, Prime Minister Fico stated that Slovakia unconditionally supports Ukraine's entry into the European Union (EU). It will not put any obstacles in its integration process. The Prime Minister of Ukraine Shmyhaľ added that he appreciates the support and readiness of Slovakia to provide Ukraine with assistance and experience in joining the Union.""We know how useful it will be not only for us, but also for you, if we have an EU member state as our next neighbor. We need you there also because sometimes countries with a different history, a different language have to unite in the EU in order to create a counterbalance to proposals that are not always beneficial for the entire Union,"" Fico stated. He pointed out that there will be countries in the EU that will ""see every possible way to ensure that Ukraine's accession process is not too fast."" According to Fico, Slovakia offers Ukraine specific expertise and exchange of experience from the integration process.At the same time, according to Fico, Slovakia will participate in all peace conferences that are supposed to end the war between Ukraine and Russia. Peace for Ukraine must be of high quality, fair, sustainable, Ukraine must have security guarantees and its sovereignty and territorial integrity must be respected. ""There probably isn't a military solution here that would satisfy one side or the other,"" Fico said. According to Shmyhaľ, they will also touch on Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's peace plan at the joint meeting.  At the same time, Fico pointed out that the development of border regions has positive effects on both sides of the border and is key to the overall development of relations between the countries. ""We also perceive the renewal and reconstruction of Ukraine in this spirit,"" he noted. According to the Prime Minister of the Slovak Republic, Slovakia has a strong interest in participating in its reconstruction. However, he will not open the topic only for the economic interests of the Slovak Republic. ""We open this topic because we think we can be helpful in certain areas. If such an opportunity arises, we will seize it in this way as well,"" he noted. Šmyhaľ praised the Slovak government's approval of the framework program for Slovakia's participation in the reconstruction of Ukraine.  According to Fico, Slovakia is also preparing another package of humanitarian aid and the 14th package of military aid with a focus on non-lethal aid. Emergency supplies of electricity will also continue. Fico wants to go to the next EU summit with the idea that he will propose a systemic solution to the issue of energy aid. ""This must also be transferred to the EU level so that it is not only the responsibility of Slovakia and Ukraine. We have a single energy market and we need it to work in relation to Ukraine as well,"" said the Slovak Prime Minister.    Šmyhaľ believes that the meeting with the Slovak government will be effective, will bring results, support relations and ensure peace and stability. He pointed out that he has had positive experiences with the Slovak Republic in finding joint solutions. According to him, the countries are attuned to find a common vision when introducing new projects.At the same time, Fico told Šmyhaľ that he will be always welcome anywhere in Slovakia."

"Slovak Pro-Russain PM Fico vows to block Ukraine’s NATO membership","It's crazy that a country with an active military of just 19,500 and a defense budget of 2.85 billion USD  can block the decisions of an alliance with an active military of 3,869,402 and a combined defense budget of 1.474 trillion USD."

"Slovak Pro-Russain PM Fico vows to block Ukraine’s NATO membership","Slovak Prime Minister Fico is a dirty traitor and an enemy of European democracy. This bastard should end up in The Hague as an accomplice to the Russian imperialist policy, which he constantly supports with his statements. And soon he will also support it by concrete action."
"Slovak Pro-Russain PM Fico vows to block Ukraine’s NATO membership","Robert Fico is looking for some safe hideout when he leaves the office.  I guess a little villa for him and his mistress next to Yanukovich villa will do."
"Slovak Pro-Russain PM Fico vows to block Ukraine’s NATO membership","Slovak Prime Minister Robert Fico has declared his intention to block Ukraine from joining NATO as long as he remains in office, according to a report by Politico on 6 October. This stance contrasts sharply with the position of NATO’s leadership, which aims to include Ukraine in the alliance after the end of its war with Russia.The admission of new countries to NATO requires unanimous agreement from all member states, as stipulated in the alliance’s 1949 founding treaty. This means that Fico’s opposition could potentially block Ukraine’s membership until at least 2027, when his current term is set to end.On Slovak TV, Fico stated,“As long as I am head of the Slovak government, I will direct the MPs that are under my control as chairman of the [ruling Smer] party never to agree to Ukraine’s joining NATO.”Fico’s declaration stands in opposition to the recent statement by NATO’s new Secretary-General Mark Rutte, who said on 3 October,“Ukraine is closer to NATO than ever before, and will continue on this path until you become a member of our alliance.”Since his reelection last fall, Fico has reversed Slovakia’s previous policy of providing material support to Ukraine in its war against Russian invasion. He has promised that his government will send “not another bullet” to Ukraine and has instead sought to improve relations with Moscow, aligning with the approach of Hungaria’s pro-Russian Prime Minister Viktor Orbán.On 3 October, Fico pledged to “do everything possible for the renewal of economic and standard relations with Russia.” He further emphasized this stance on 6 October by proposing to visit Moscow next May for the 80th anniversary of the end of World War II in Europe, “as long as I’m invited.”Pro-Russian Robert Fico won Slovakia’s parliamentary elections last fall, repeatedly promising to halt weapons supplies to Ukraine. Fico has so far stopped his country’s military support to Ukraine and opposes Ukraine’s NATO accession."

"The Abandonment of Ukraine","Its sad, but predictable. West does not want Ruzzia to lose, and will not ""escalate"" situation by getting UA in NATO, or even giving us sufficient arms to defeat them. It was all by design. But sadly Ruzzia found better good partners in Iran-NK-China and they get lots more weapons now. They are not planning on stopping - why would they?Ether our (UA) political class gets the fucking memo and decides to build nukes FAST, or we are going to dissapear as a country under constant Ruzzian bobmardement.

"The Abandonment of Ukraine","A lot of despair in the comments, but from my POV I see ruzzian economy visibly crumbling.  Doesn't look like it can survive 2025.  Moreover, ruzzia also has soldier shortages.  From the looks of it, putler is betting on making Ukraine surrender in the next couple of months, which is unrealistic.    And if it doesn't happen, we might see ruzzians fleeing from occupied territories (bcs no manpower to hold them) and ruzzia collapsing into 10+ states.  Though, if putler orders second wave of mass mobilization it won't happen, but then it might cause great civil unrest inside ruzzia. And on the background of this unrest would be ruzzian economy collapsing."

"The Abandonment of Ukraine","Articles like this hurt because while it is ultimately an opinion piece, it's not exactly lacking in some data and trends. They're not unsympathetic either - their pain stems from the idea that the US is half-assing something that cannot be half-assed. I unfortunately tend to agree. I wish like hell we in the US could just say, ""we're going to win in Ukraine and this is how, and why, and when."" It would cost more up front, Americans would complain of the cost and effort more... and it would ultimately be cheaper AND better for Ukraine. The current strategy seeks to remain just below the level of public opinion and Russian escalation needed to ""continue"" aid...but that also means we inherently stay below the threshold needed to be decisive. We're in the dugout next to a guy fighting for his life. If we shoot for him, we're in the war too. If we give him our rifle and grenades, we might wonder if we can do without. So we're tossing him rifle rounds, one at a time, and hoping that he can make each shot count. If he doesn't, every round he fires just calls more attention to him until he finally goes down.We just need to start shooting for him, really."

"The Abandonment of Ukraine","1) BS. Their basic drones cost $5k. If you're replacing the functionality of a HIMARS with a $1k drone, you've been using the HIMARS wrong.""Each rocket fired by HIMARS costs roughly $100,000. Because of the rapid decrease in HIMARS’s effectiveness, the Ukrainians have developed a drone that has a similar impact of the early HIMARS and costs about $1,000. ""2) The cost of things is right on point. Now that Ukraine has homegrown missile/drone tech that they can strike Russia with, the materials for those items, however close to finished form, can be manufactured elsewhere to be assembled in Ukraine. They're making stuff that works a lot cheaper than the US companies, and they're allowed to hit targets that need to be hit."

"New details emerge on Russia’s S-70 drone loss over Ukraine","Initial reports and footage circulated on social media showed Russian forces downing what was later identified as the S-70 drone, one of the most advanced unmanned systems in development by Russia.At present, Russia has only a few prototypes of the S-70 “Okhotnik,” which is being developed with technology drawn from the Su-57 fifth-generation fighter jet. The drone is part of Moscow’s efforts to field a fleet of heavy, stealthy unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) that can carry out strike and reconnaissance missions in coordination with manned aircraft.According to reports, a pair of aircraft, consisting of a piloted Su-57 and the unmanned S-70, took off from Akhtubinsk Air Base, located about 365 miles from the front lines, for an operational test flight. The mission was part of the drone’s experimental trials, aiming to test its capabilities in live combat situations. However, a technical malfunction caused the drone to lose contact with its ground operator, veering off course toward Ukrainian-controlled territory.Panic ensued among the Russian military responsible for the test. Radio intercepts from the flight control center revealed that ground commanders ordered the accompanying Su-57 pilot to attempt to disrupt the rogue drone’s flight path, even suggesting using the aircraft’s wing to divert it. Ultimately, a decision was made to launch an air-to-air missile to bring down the drone.The S-70 “Okhotnik” crashed in Kostiantynivka, just 16 kilometers from the frontline, and its remnants were recovered by Ukrainian forces. Initial assessments of the wreckage cast doubt on Russian claims about the drone’s advanced capabilities. Contrary to Russian propaganda, the S-70 does not appear to feature the stealth polymers or advanced artificial intelligence systems that were advertised. “This is no advanced combat drone,” a Ukrainian defense expert said. “It’s more like a glider equipped with basic flight capabilities and radio controls.”Additionally, the use of the Su-57 manned fighter as a command relay for the drone was seen as inefficient and highlighted the limitations of Russian networking capabilities. The S-70 lacks the robust stealth technologies that Russia has claimed to possess, and it does not feature the kind of network-centric systems comparable to NATO’s Link-16. Instead, the drone relies on a basic radio link for guidance, limiting its operational flexibility.The Russian Ministry of Defense has long promoted the S-70 as a “loyal wingman” to the Su-57, capable of engaging in coordinated missions and using a wide range of airborne weaponry. However, the incident casts doubt on the drone’s ability to execute sophisticated combat maneuvers, including the use of air-to-air missiles or precision-guided weaponry."
"New details emerge on Russia’s S-70 drone loss over Ukraine","Let me guess. They blew up trillions of rubles on the promise of a stealth, autonomous UAV. The money got spent on yachts and villas and all they got is an RC plane which cannot even get a command to go back home (like most drones out there)."

"New details emerge on Russia’s S-70 drone loss over Ukraine","So much for a “loyal wingman.” The S-70, so tired of Russian service it tried to runaway, was shot down by its own wingman.That will teach Russian tech to trust its masters. Ironically, even with its clear disadvantages compared with foreign competitors, even its minimally intelligent technology proved smarter than its human counterparts who still toil mindlessly in Putin’s machinery of death."

"New details emerge on Russia’s S-70 drone loss over Ukraine","I suppose it kind of makes tactical sense to have a big UAV escorting their best fighters as an additional weapons platform / extra target for enemy fighters.  If this were its main purpose then it could be cheaply made.  Simply an extra add-on to the fighters it links to. Which will take the hit when intercepted by enemy aircraft.Where this becomes ‘very Russian’ is where it’s been sold as a 6 Gen super stealth autonomous hunter-killer that costs billions of rubles.Did it ever cost much? Money siphoned off by underhand project leaders.  Or was it all just propaganda and being rolled out at a pittance?"

"New details emerge on Russia’s S-70 drone loss over Ukraine","Some sources are saying that Ukr hijacked the Command Link and ordered the drone to head towards a Ukr airfield. The order to destroy the drone was an attempt by RuAF to avoid having the drone captured"
"New details emerge on Russia’s S-70 drone loss over Ukraine","Hmmm. This all seems so fishy. Might be an unpopular opinion, but it would be very beneficial for Musk and Putin to change the narrative that he's using starlink and high tech on his drones.. what better way than to make a shirt drone that looks like an S-70 but has dumb trucks and then to shoot it down over Ukraine?  Win win win: give West false sense of security, take heat off them for using starlinks and other high tech, and improve black market for high tech by taking some heat off of it as West won't be as hard-pressed to look into it? Ukraine gained nothing here. This could have been a test mule too with dumber tech, testing things like aerodynamics. We gain nothing by letting our guard down."

Their main positions are fairly predictable and ideologically driven. The idea that the US has swept in and bought up a lot of the land is far fetched and clearly driven by a Kremlin agenda to distract from the real truth that Russia has swept in and now controls more Ukrainian land than any other foreign actor, around 17-18 percent.

"Losses of the Russian military to 6.10.2024","On the front lines, the Russian army’s offensive continued in the same directions.- In the Kursk region, Russian sources report that the Russian army has gained control over two settlements, but there has been no confirmation of this. Battles are ongoing at several points, but the Russian army has not yet managed to launch a major offensive.- In the northern part of Vovchansk in the Kharkiv direction, battles continue and there have been no significant changes in the situation.- A very active offensive continues towards the cities of Kupiansk and Lyman. Yesterday, the Russian army was not able to make significant progress. Social media channels reported advancements by Russian units in the Siversk direction yesterday. However, there has been no confirmation of this, and according to Ukrainian sources, it was relatively quiet in this sector.- In the Bahmut area, the pressure continues towards Chasiv Yar, but Russian units have not managed to improve their positions. Serious urban battles continue on the southern and eastern edges of Toretsk city. Since predominantly small infantry units operate in the grey zone of the front line, the situation in this limited area is very fluid. The Russian army has not achieved any major advancements.- On the Pokrovsk city direction, the pressure from Russian units slightly increased yesterday, but they only managed marginal improvements in their positions. The most severe attacks are continuing southwest of Donetsk, where Russian units have managed to move forward slightly in some points.- On the southern front, Russian units conducted a few reconnaissance battles and were generally passive. The local Ukrainian military command continues active communication, indicating that Russian units are preparing for a larger offensive in this area."

"allegedly a video of Russian Su-25 being shot down today ","I have real doubt this is Ukraine shooting down a Russia SU-25 the video makes little sense. One is just how close the supposed Ukraine fighter is to the russia plane. Given the range of the anti air missile ability it makes zero sense why he would get this close.Second the Russia plane does not move or deploy any counter measures. Of course at this distance we cannot be sure of the events up to this point but the supposed plane shot down does not move. The idea as someone suggested he was not aware of the Ukraine plane is impossible.I have seen a report this was friendly fire which seems difficult to believe but this is Russia and at least it would explain the video.The only other possible idea is the plane is shooting down a large drone or missile of some kind."
"allegedly a video of Russian Su-25 being shot down today ","Maybe Ukraine had digitally hijacked the drone, and Russia shot it down so Ukraine couldn't have it"
"allegedly a video of Russian Su-25 being shot down today ","The only thing you can clearly see in the video is a two engine aircraft shooting down a single engine aircraft. So unlikely to be a su-25. That also means the attacker is not a f-16.Also it is very hard to look directly behind and below in a plane so the splashed craft wasn't necessarily unmanned. You don't have radar coverage behind your plane and an IRST lock / a fox 2 don't give you a rwr warning. So it's entirely possible not to notice an enemy behind you until you get splashed."

The German media adds to some news  ""Information ... cannot be verified directly by an independent body in the current situation.""  This is what I miss in the article.  2. Purely technically speaking, Russian soldiers are also people.  I put this first because the article verbatim says:  ""... Nine people were wounded when a Ukrainian drone struck a passenger bus in the city of Horlivka in the  partially occupied Donetsk region, the city’s Russian-installed Mayor Ivan Prikhodko said. ...""  So it is not ""civilians"" it is ""people"".  I find it annoying that foreign press is spreading information from Russian sources without any comment."

It is known that only two of these were built.Pic of one https://imgur.com/iMYEXCIUpdate update:A brief description of the entire incident with the crash of the Russian aircraft in one post: About two hours ago, reports began to appear in both Ukrainian and Russian sources about the downing of an aircraft in the Konstantynivka area, Donetsk front. Almost immediately after this, in a short time, a number of photos and videos from the site of the wreckage followed. According to the published material, it became clear that this was a Russian aircraft that crashed on territory controlled by Ukraine. However, at first, an erroneous conclusion was made that the wreckage belonged to a Su-25. A small detail that some immediately noticed was an atypical camouflage pattern that had not previously been seen on Russian Su-25s. Then followed the publication of a number of videos by various sources showing that the aircraft was shot down by friendly Russian fire from another aircraft, as well as videos of the wreckage falling to the ground. The shape of the falling wreckage did not match the shape of the Su-25 fuselage. As a result, with the publication of even more material and clearer photos of the wreckage, it was finally established that the downed aircraft was a Russian Sukhoi S-70 Okhotnik-B stealth heavy unmanned combat aerial vehicle (UCAV).🧵More videos and photos of the crash site, moment of friendly fire incident and falling debris available in attached threadhttps://x.com/bayraktar_1love/status/1842521933599883414"

"Losses of the Russian military to 5.10.2024","On the front lines, the Russian army’s offensive continued in the same directions.- In the Kursk region, Russian sources report that the Russian army has gained control over two settlements, but there has been no confirmation of this. Battles are ongoing at several points, but the Russian army has not yet managed to launch a major offensive.- In the northern part of Vovchansk in the Kharkiv direction, battles continue and there have been no significant changes in the situation.- A very active offensive continues towards the cities of Kupiansk and Lyman. Yesterday, the Russian army was not able to make significant progress. Social media channels reported advancements by Russian units in the Siversk direction yesterday. However, there has been no confirmation of this, and according to Ukrainian sources, it was relatively quiet in this sector.- In the Bahmut area, the pressure continues towards Chasiv Yar, but Russian units have not managed to improve their positions. Serious urban battles continue on the southern and eastern edges of Toretsk city. Since predominantly small infantry units operate in the grey zone of the front line, the situation in this limited area is very fluid. The Russian army has not achieved any major advancements.- On the Pokrovsk city direction, the pressure from Russian units slightly increased yesterday, but they only managed marginal improvements in their positions. The most severe attacks are continuing southwest of Donetsk, where Russian units have managed to move forward slightly in some points.- On the southern front, Russian units conducted a few reconnaissance battles and were generally passive. The local Ukrainian military command continues active communication, indicating that Russian units are preparing for a larger offensive in this area."

Ukrainian servicemen of the Azov brigade light flares during the funeral ceremony of a fallen comrade in Travkine, Chernihiv region, Ukraine, Oct. 4, 2024.Ukraine has documented evidence related to the execution of 93 Ukrainian prisoners of war, according to a law enforcement official tasked with investigating war crimes related to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine.Yuriy Belousov, who heads the Prosecutor-General's Office’s department in charge of investigating crimes committed in armed conflict, provided the latest figure during a live television appearance on October 4.""Now we have information about the death of 93 of our soldiers who were executed on the battlefield,"" Belousov told Yedyniy Novyny, a broadcast that unites multiple Ukrainian television channels.Belousov said that about 80% of the executions were recorded this year, but that the number of executions began rising in November ""when there were changes for the worse in the attitude of Russian servicemen toward our prisoners of war.""On October 1, the Prosecutor-General’s Office announced it had opened an investigation into what it described as the ""largest mass execution"" of Ukrainian prisoners of war by Russian troops since the start of Moscow's full-scale invasion in February 2022.According to an official statement published on the office’s Telegram channel, Russian forces recently killed 16 Ukrainian ""prisoners of war"" near the villages of Mykolayivka and Sukhiy Yar in the Pokrovsk district of the Donetsk region.Videos circulated on various Telegram channels appear to show Ukrainian soldiers, freshly captured by Russian troops, emerging from a forested area.After the prisoners have lined up, Russian forces appear to open fire. The videos then appear to show Russian soldiers approaching those who were only wounded and shooting them again at close range with machine guns.The videos have not been independently verified.Under international humanitarian law, executing soldiers who have surrendered is considered a war crime.Ukraine's Commissioner for Human Rights Dmytro Lubinets said he had contacted both the United Nations and the International Committee of the Red Cross over the deaths, citing violations of the Geneva Conventions, which govern the treatment of prisoners of war.In March, the UN Human Rights Monitoring Mission in Ukraine published a report that recorded the execution of at least 32 Ukrainian prisoners of war in 12 separate cases from December 2023 to February 2024"

There had already been multiple bomb and rocket strikes in the street.The mother had no doubts and desperately wanted to leave with her son Lyosha, but the grandmother refused. We couldn’t convince her, and so the grandmother was left behind alone. Unfortunately, this happens more often. Many older people do not want to leave to build a new future elsewhere.

"Stoltenberg regrets delayed military aid to Ukraine. Former NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg admitted that his greatest regret was the late delivery of weapons to Ukraine, which he believes could have strengthened its defenses and possibly deterred Russia’s invasion.","Another article on this - We should have given Ukraine more weapons earlier, says ex-NATO chief“I’m proud of what we have done, but it would have been a great advantage if it started earlier,” Jens Stoltenberg said. Ukraine’s allies should have supplied Kyiv with more arms before Moscow’s full-scale invasion to prevent the war, NATO’s former chief said Friday.“If there’s anything I in a way regret and see much more clearly now is that we should have provided Ukraine with much more military support much earlier,” Jens Stoltenberg told the Financial Times. “I think we all have to admit, we should have given them more weapons pre-invasion.”Stoltenberg, a former Norwegian prime minister, led NATO between 2014 and 2024, making him the second-longest-serving chief in the alliance’s history. ****Prior to Moscow’s full-scale invasion in early 2022, he said, “sending lethal weapons [to Ukraine] was a big discussion****.”“****Most allies were against that, pre-invasion … they were very afraid of the consequences,” he said. “I’m proud of what we have done, but it would have been a great advantage if it started earlier****.“****It maybe could even have prevented the invasion, or at least made it much harder for [Russia] to do what they’ve done****.”Throughout the conflict, Kyiv has begged its Western allies for more advanced weapons, including long-range missiles, battle tanks and Patriot air defense systems. Some, such as Germany, eventually relented on some requests while steadfastly refusing others.****Ukraine’s allies “should have given them more advanced weapons, faster, after the invasion,” Stoltenberg said. “I take my part of the responsibility,”**** he added.During Stoltenberg’s decade at the NATO helm, the alliance withdrew from Afghanistan at the initiative of the United States. Stoltenberg said NATO’s speedy departure from the country amounted to a broken promise not to leave until “the Afghans can protect their own country and ensure the Taliban doesn’t return.”He also presided over NATO during former U.S. President Donald Trump’s term and was lauded for keeping the alliance together, even as Trump repeatedly threatened to pull out unless other members boosted their military spending.“Whether it was a 10 per cent likelihood that NATO would collapse under Trump or 90 per cent, it didn’t change what we had to do,” Stoltenberg said.Stoltenberg was replaced by former Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Tuesday and is expected to take a new role as chairman of the Munich Security Conference."

"Rethinking Ukraine's NATO future with the new Secretary General: the outcome of Rutte's visit to Kyiv","The guy is a great politician...But he is really lacking in vision (he has said it himself as well).  This has led to him making dissensions more focused on the short term without really thinking through the long term effects. In his first term they decided that a housing minister was unneeded and now we have a giant housing shortage. The tax and benefits authority had to crack down on fraud which was done to such an extreme extent that many many normal people where unjustly marked as fraudulent. The inability to handle immigration, and especially process them became such a problem that brought the far right to the forefront in the Netherlands. Now of course we can not lay all of those issues at the feet of one man but the fact that his final cabinet/government was mostly spent trying and failing to deal with the systemic issues that the last 13 or so years under his leadership had created (or massively exacerbated) does not speak so well about his ability to think in the long term.Still i do have to say that he is quite good at wrangling many different people to work somewhat in the same direction, again he is a great politician, but i really hope that he has learned that the long term effects of current (in)actions really needs to be taken into account."

But now he traveled all over Ukraine to raise money for Ukrainian defenders. This report is from the time when he was back in his hometown, and people were so happy to see him. ""Uncle Hrisha is the resilience of our people of Kherson, especially when the Russian military was here. Despite everything, he remains the most inspiring,"" says Kherson resident Olena.""I’m glad to see him because he is the greatest patriot of Kherson. I trust him like no one else. Since 2014, he’s been raising money to help our military. He used to sit near the 'Factory’ \[In Kherson -ed.\]. And when the occupation began, he started riding around playing Ukrainian songs, unafraid of the Russian military. Tears come to my eyes when I see him. When I read that he wasn’t around, it made me sad. I was waiting for him to return to Kherson,"" says Liudmila.Uncle Hrisha says that during the occupation of Kherson, he went on this route every day.""You understand, it was always scary, every morning when I left. Because you always leave on your route but aren’t sure you’ll return. So it was always scary. It's not scary for those who just lie at home on the couch and talk about the occupation and other things. But I still worked towards our victory,"" he says.""Each time \[when returning to Kherson - ed.\] the city becomes more battered, with many damaged houses. I understand that they \[Russians - ed.\] can’t capture Kherson but can make the city resemble Bakhmut, Mariupol, and all the cities they couldn’t capture. It’s very difficult to accept this; every time you come, one building is destroyed, then another,"" said the volunteer.Hryhoriy Yanchenko says that during this visit to Kherson, he has another goal – to donate an exhibit to the Museum of Resistance - a bucket he used to collect donations between 2014 and now. “This bucket is very symbolic,” says Hrisha. Hryhoriy Yanchenko will be in Kherson for a few days. He says he’s already expected in Kropyvnytskyi and will then head to eastern Ukraine.""If you stay in one place, donations decrease. So I decided at the beginning of this year, since January, to travel around the cities. My friends sometimes say, 'Oh, you’ve gone on a journey!' Well, journey or not, but I support two brigades. Last time, I delivered 25 FPV drones, 15 to one and 10 to the other. It all depends on donations. Besides drones, I also deliver Starlinks, medicine, and various consumables – plastic coverings,insulation,"" says the man.Overall, Hryhoriy Yanchenko has visited 21 cities in Ukraine. He says that since the beginning of the full-scale invasion, he has managed to raise about 3.5 million hryvnias for the needs of the Defense Forces, and since 2014 – nine million altogether.""Sometimes I feel like saying: that's it, I'm done. You understand, I’m 77 years old, and it’s very difficult to travel by train, bus, or minibus. But still, in the evening, you think one thing, and in the morning, you wake up, and your perspective has changed. You think: how are those soldiers standing there day and night, every hour? So, you keep working. When the left bank is liberated, I’ll go there too; I won’t miss that opportunity. If I have the chance, I’ll definitely be on the left bank. And Skadovsk, Zaliznyi Port, Novovorontsovka, Henichesk – I’ll visit everywhere,"" says Uncle Hrisha.Source: [https://suspilne.media/kherson/796217-podorozue-ukrainou-j-zbirae-grosi-dla-zsu-dada-grisa-na-kilka-dniv-povernuvsa-do-ridnogo-hersona/](https://suspilne.media/kherson/796217-podorozue-ukrainou-j-zbirae-grosi-dla-zsu-dada-grisa-na-kilka-dniv-povernuvsa-do-ridnogo-hersona/) "

I understand that this is not very popular.... but he does look at the war from a very scientific and also humanistic and democratic perspective.I understand the frustration many commentators here have with Austrias Politics --- but please also consider that the Population of Austria is very vastly in Solidarity with Ukraine and that over 60.000 Ukrainian Refugees are in Austria since the Start of the War and warmly welcome. So ..... no.... Austria is not ""in Putins Ass"" as some here claim. Im sorry, but this is bullshit.You could blame Switzerland much more, actually. Because they do not even support the EU sanctions clearly! Austria has always done so and will do.

"When the West Decided Ukraine Should Not Win","I think that the point is another: IMO the West is terrorized of having another collapse of ~~the soviet onion~~ russia.I am a simple old Italian and I think that the only way to finally have some peace and quiet, is the final collapse of russia, because an 11 time zones country as our neighbour is dangerous and it will bring only more other wars of land grabbing."
"When the West Decided Ukraine Should Not Win","The West is 40 democracies with varying strength and priorities, it doesn't have a common strategy on Ukraine.Too bad many of the larger economies are disappointments but there are other countries in the West who have nearly emptied their entire military. Had everyone acted like the Baltic or most of the Nordic countries Ukraine would have been sieging Moscow by now."
"When the West Decided Ukraine Should Not Win","I am deeply saddened and disappointed with this. Don't they know that if Ukraine looses, they loose too. If Ukraine looses than the Third World War witch they are fighting will expand and engulf them. I say to them it's time to stop dragging your feet and support Ukraine and if they don't than nobody will be there to help you when Russia attacks you. But what do they care about what I say they have ""better things to worry about"" than WW3 and the death of freedom, the loss of liberty and the extinguishment of the fire of freedom and liberty  and the dissapearace of the light of hope into the darkness of fear and uncertainty. I don't know about you but I don't want a Third World War because I know that I'd have to fight in it.Victory to Ukraine, the free world is behind you, it's not just your fight, it's my fight too even from the United States, it's everyone's fight, it's our fight, and we will win."
"When the West Decided Ukraine Should Not Win","Writing as a total Ukraine supporter.First, hindsight is 20-20.Second, it is fair to say that Biden has erred on the side of caution and his been unwilling to gamble on a larger war or nuclear exchange.Lastly nothing in 2022 would prevent Moscow from waging a long campaign.  Moscow, having resolved to reclaim lost pieces of the empire, has shown a willingness to inflict tremendous suffering on its own people as well as Ukraine in this war of conquest.  Wars are prevented when both sides recoil from the costs.  Moscow yet shows no reluctance.What the West should do is equip Ukraine with the means to kill as many Russians as possible while sparing the Ukrainians as much suffering as possible, until the Russian people themselves are too few or too unwilling to continue the war."

"Today marked the funeral of David Knowles, presenter and founder of the Ukraine: the latest podcast, flowers were donated by the Ukrainian embassy. 🇬🇧 💙💛🇺🇦","Edit - probably should’ve said remembrance service*. He will be buried in islay*** (sorry relistened & heard it correctly), Scotland overlooking the sea next week. You can rewatch his extremely moving funeral here: https://youtube.com/live/cMqwb1Rc0QkHe sadly passed after a heart attack in Gibraltar and will be sadly missed by all listeners. He was 32. He started the podcast on 24th February 2022- the first day of the invasion and broadcast every single working day since then (edit for Ronin, reaching an audience of **100 million+**.) For many of us, his soothing voice was part of our daily routine- a true, gentle friend of Ukraine working rigorously to reveal the true evil of the enemy. Alongside the evil, he discovered the beauty of Ukrainian culture - I remember a particular podcast was about the rise of Ukrainian cricket (which was a massive passion of his on a personal level, you could tell his passion in combining these topics). Cc: (I love an edit when I care about something) here: https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/ukraine-the-latest/id1612424182?i=1000658193134 — cricket @ 18:40 💘He was not only interested in the culture of Ukraine but her people…. All sorts of people. From charities helping Ukrainians, to a 16yo American school girl raising money to buy a school bus. So many people have praised him & the pod for actually promoting fundraisers which have received thousands of ££ off the back of it. These are just a handful of the things the podcast (and David personally), covered - it has been going for 2 years, 7 months when he passed. Needless to say, those podcasts (and much more) **are his legacy**, amongst - lot else he fit in his 32 years. His funeral is entwined with hymns (he picked out himself whilst talking to a friend), and emotionally moving tributes from his family and his 2 fellow podcast pals - Dom and Francis. As a tribute to him, dom and Francis and friends will continue the pod. You can just tell he was one of life’s most excellent, self sacrificing people. Thanks David.  And as Dom said in his tribute to him today: Slava Ukrainii, **Slava David**.(I could keep editing this forever and never do him justice. Plus I don’t want to cry any more. Cheers, David pal, wherever you are now.) 💙(Edit edit I know this is a lot — I’m sorry, this pod has just been kind of home for the last few years, so it’s hit me deep since he passed🥺)Edit edit edit have I achieved the world record for the most edits ever yet 🥺My last edit tonight - thanks David. Goodnight. Your intelligence, empathy and kindness spoke volumes. I will think about you forever."

But just wanted to share one of David’s more vulnerable moments with you - thanks u/MIC4eva for the reminder and please bear with me as I am not good at transcribing… 🥺From Sunny Days in Kramatorsk Part II (the name of the episode alone makes me weirdly emotional… https://podcasts.apple.com/gb/podcast/ukraine-the-latest/id1612424182?i=1000639720955 (26/12/2023)‘After saying our goodbyes, we jumped on a train to Kyiv and started the long, slow process of leaving the country. Evgenia (please correct me on UA spelling) and his friends went back to the front to fight. I, went home to london. After 10 days, my journey was over. Hi, listeners, it’s David here. It’s now been 6 months since I travelled from London to Kramatorsk and I’ve waited so long before recording this ending. Enough time for the adrenaline and excitement of the journey to wear off and the memories to sink in. For Christmas, I have come to visit family on the western Scottish island of Islay. Outside, a winter storm is raging, rain is lashing against the windows and the wind is bending sparse trees. From here, my trip in June now feels something of a surreal dream. From hearing the first air raid sirens interwoven with Christian prayer to bumping along the back streets of Kramatorsk interviewing Evgenia(???) about his time fighting in Soledar  and Bakhmut.It’s now just a few days before Christmas and I find myself thinking again of Evgenia(???).I wonder if he’s still alive, what further horrors he may have witnessed, how many more of his friends have died? My final thought isn’t long. I’m less eloquent than Francis () and less worldly wise than Dom (🥺) but I can say that I hope everyone listening hears in these stories the kindness, courage and selflessness, as much as they hear the cruelty, destruction and needless suffering. I hope people realise than in the face of great evil, there’s always hope, as long as good people are courageous enough to do the right thing. And that’s true of the highest politicians, generals, dignitaries, to the most ordinary of us. From Polish/ German mechanics to volunteers from around the world who decided their friends needed help and got involved. Even to you, our listeners.’  ——————And that’s me emotionally done."

Because of this, I have to ask you again and again for your support so that the Ukrainian army can work at least a little better. In this video you can see a Mavic 3pro drone. A soldered battery is used to extend the time this device stays in the air. At the same time, increased loads on the battery increase the charge usage.

The Iraq and Afghanistan veterans, and to some degree the Vietnam veterans, who were pulled from combat and flowing back to the United States, often separated from their units and quickly put back into civilian life, we're often the ones that struggled most with combat stress. In Prior Wars the troops were kept in the hospitals near the combat zones, and they often had a month or so of travel back to the United States on ships where they could talk to other people who had experienced the same things. Also because it was Total War Society was a lot more accepting that people are going to be really messed up by what they saw and they need some extra patience and grace. I think Ukraine has the society part worked out, but they need to give the troops more time"

"Ukraine Unveils Towed Bohdana Artillery System to Foreign Partners","As I've written in a different thread, on the surface an SPH is superior to a towed howitzer, because of mobility, but comes with the drawbacks of cost and increased maintenance. Additionally, in Ukraine, crews usually dig in their towed howitzers into robust positions with ammunition stored separately. It's actually surprisingly hard to destroy these positions, especially for Russia, which doesn't have any analogue to the HIMARS.With a lower cost and less complex maintenance of a towed howitzer, Ukraine can simply field more howitzers to their brigades and these howitzers are also in action for a longer duration as they need less maintenance. Also, they need less training to use these."

","This is how any people who have garden or animals at home, prep for winter.My inlaws have huge garden, they raise 3 pigs each year that we slaughter in winter. They also have 400 vines and 130 olive trees. We ""sour"" pickles, paprikas, green tomatoes, chilly peppers, cabbage, zucchini, we mix some of those mentiones (cabbage with carrots for example) or 1 chilly goes into jar of pickles just so they are ""spicy"". We do homemade salsa, jams, ajvar, and a mixture of veggies that I don't know english name of it - we call it ""đuveč"" - onions, tomatoes, carrots, parsnip, parsley - all is slowly cooked for couple of hours and then goes into glass jars. Currently, there are surely 500+ glass jars of everything. This month we'll pick olives so we will have shitton of olive oil, we already tried ""young"" red wine and it's amazing. From pigs we dry age prosciuttos, sausages, salamis, dried pork loins, dried pork necks, bones for soups, skins for minestronis..As I'm a hunter, I shot a pig last winter and I brought to them a wild pig prosciutto. We dryaged him for 7 months and then we ate it. My God how good that stuff is. When meat is dryaged, we ""trancher"" that meat and we ""vacuum seal"" it. We put it then into fridge, but it can be placed on shelves like that for year or more and it wouldn't be anything wrong with it. Wife and I live together for 4 years and when we started to live together, we bought 1 liter of sunflower oil. We used half liter of it and that's it, we threw rest away. In next 4 years we never bought 1 liter of it again.95% of food we cook on our olive oil, rest is on lard from our pigs. So everything is homemade and homegrown.And anybody who has a garden or raises some cattle, has similar stuff at their home."

"First trip to Ukraine from the USA tomorrow. What should I know?","You probably need a 1-2 day in any oblast centre. Plan your trips for railway as much as possible - very reliable transport service. Don't photo anything military (unless it's a public place and soldiers are definitely off duty). Be prepared that a lot of touristic places are in the walking distance, so you will walk a lot - have a good shoes. Public transport is different in every city, so clarify with locals if you plan to use tram or a bus"

"First trip to Ukraine from the USA tomorrow. What should I know?","Ignore these clueless idiots who are telling you that Lviv (yes, Lviv, not Lvov) is an active warzone. It is not. Go and enjoy yourself. Mind the air raid alerts, keep your documents on you, don't take pics of military stuff, don't stay past the curfew and avoid speaking russian.   Odesa (not Odessa), might no be such a good plan though."
"First trip to Ukraine from the USA tomorrow. What should I know?","Why are people so angry in these comments…Is it directly involving you? No it’s not..Ukraine is a beautiful country, it should be seen as such regardless of the times we are in. Anywhere you go in the world, you run the risk of something happening. If you live in fear because of X, Y & Z then just stay home. To the OP, I hope you have a nice trip and enjoy yourself regardless of what these trolls say. Be safe, keep the raid app on and phones charged. Also, keep a 48 hour bag with supplies incase you need to leave for x amount of time. Be prepared to sit and wait if a raid is going on because it can be a LONG time. Usually when shelling is going on there are follow up shellings shortly after so don’t be too excited to leave shelter.Take care!"
"First trip to Ukraine from the USA tomorrow.

Give it a try, good luck and enjoy the country and its people."
"First trip to Ukraine from the USA tomorrow. What should I know?","It's  a good idea to have a little bit of cash on hand, but check what currencies you need for the places you are going. If you're going to the UK, then it'll be pounds, EU countries Euros, and other European countries outside the EU each have their own currencies.Most of the time, you'll be able to use your credit/debit card, but obviously, you'll get a bank charge, so you might want cash for small purchases like snacks. Also, you do occasionally come across small shops that only accept cash.Not a wedge of cash though, just perhaps the equivalent of $30-50 in your pocket."

"First trip to Ukraine from the USA tomorrow. What should I know?","Stayed in Ukraine for 5 months with my Girlfriend from January - June. Ukrainians want you to go there and see their country, absolutely. I just cannot emphasise how important it is to stay vigilant and stay safe. I only experienced a handful of shelling's, but they left me shaken and unwell. Imagine having to experience that everyday. We visited Odesa in April. 26th-28th. Luckily, only one drone came our way. We stayed in Arcadia (I highly recommend this area). However, the day we came back, Ruzzia quite literally fired a cluster munition into the beach area, killing a dog and a person. It was the same beach we were just at, two days before. Those are the moments that remind you: you're in a warzone. While I do agree Lviv is safe-ish, it is not completely safe from Ruzzian terrorism. They fly drones and missiles there, hitting civilians, just to prove to Ukrainians that they CAN do that. So, please, react to alarms. Download telegram, join channels, if anything is to happen they will give you instant updates on where the missile/drone is. You can translate it in-app if you hold down on the message. If not, just run it through google translate. Have fun, stay safe, and don't be naive. It is a wonderful country, I hope you enjoy it!"

"First trip to Ukraine from the USA tomorrow. What should I know?","Forget all the hate here, you will be fine. People forget that you can die anytime and anywhere. Where I am in Ukraine the chance of getting killed at an pedestrian crossing is the biggest direct! thread to my foreigners life.99 out of 100 cars ignore them.Enjoy Lviv and if shit hits the fan, you die doing something you enjoyed.Not the worst way to go."
"First trip to Ukraine from the USA tomorrow. What should I know?","Get bolt and uklon it will be easier for you than using buses and Uber don't really work here and super expensive if you happen to get one. I wouldn't bother about the air raid app it will just stop you getting sleep, if you are unlucky enough to get hit then you are unlucky enough to get hit just choose accommodation that isn't in government or industrial districts, or near a power plant, hospital or huge shopping mall. If you do that there is pretty much zero chance of getting hit in Odesa or Kyiv. Don't take photos of checkpoints and definitely don't record air defence and strikes or if you do do not post them."
"First trip to Ukraine from the USA tomorrow. What should I know?","American here, who spent the summer in Lviv, and the last 2 years bouncing around Eastern/Southern Europe. Nobody pays attention to the air raid sirens in Lviv. An eSIM for your phone is the best bet, unless your phone is quite old. Some providers may not let you eSIM if you’re making payments on your phone. I arrived by bus with no delays. And that was the only time I was asked for my passport, but yeah keep it with you."

"First trip to Ukraine from the USA tomorrow. What should I know?","I went to Kyiv in December 2023. I am Canadian. Lviv is not bad at all, but my friends in the legion may not let me set foot in Odesa. They love the city and are considering moving there after the war is over. Lviv and Kyiv are the safest major cities. Bring the amount of cash that you think you need (and then some) because your cards will most likely be blocked for fraud prevention. Do all your medical/dentist stuff in Ukraine, it’s so much cheaper than the US, and I don’t have to wait (I’m Canadian). Also , unlike in Canada, doctors don’t call me hysterical when I ask for a thyroid panel. If you have western money, the Ukrainian medical system is great. The first bomb is really scary, but you get used to it after that. The third drop felt like a fireworks show for me."

If there is a political will, Western countries can invest heavily in them and leverage their larger economies to overwhelm the Russian war economy.

"Ukraine wants UN nuclear watchdog to place foreign observers near all its nuclear plants","This is still strange. The article makes clear they mean near but not in. The fear isn’t that Russia will release radiation, but continue targeting electrical infrastructure (transformers, etc.)Putting the UN at these sites would help, but then, why not every transfer station? Does hitting the stations cause risk to the safety of the plant?"

"Winnipeg Jets unveil reimagined logo embroidered with Ukrainian heritage","I fought alongside Canadians on a couple of deployments in Afghanistan while part of US teams embedded  with the Afghan National Army Commando Corps. I still remain friends with a few of the guys & while travelling overseas on business  l woke up to multiple messages informing me of this, as the guys know l am of Ukrainian heritage & have just got back from another Aid mission to the front line units . So looking  forward to receiving a Hoody they are sending me for Xmas .https://i.cbc.ca/1.7341130.1727922293!/fileImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/original_1180/winnipeg-jets-ukrainian-heritage-logo.jpgAnnouncement on official site : Winnipeg Jets unveil Ukrainian Heritage Night logo:The Winnipeg Jets today unveiled their new Ukrainian Heritage logo in celebration of the team’s first Ukrainian Heritage Night game on Jan. 2, 2025.The logo was created by Andrii Sobchuk, who was born in Lutsk, Ukraine and relocated to Canada with his family to continue his graphic design career with True North Sports + Entertainment after the war began in 2022.Sobchuk’s design incorporates geometric patterns from Ukrainian embroidery often found on the sleeves of embroidered shirts (vyshyvankas) and the edges of towels (rushnyks). The design includes eight-pointed stars, also known as mallows, which symbolize the joining of masculine and feminine energies and the stable order and harmony that prevail in the universe and in each person's life.Rather than featuring the traditional red, black and white associated with Ukrainian embroidery, blue and yellow are used to reflect the colors of the Ukrainian flag. These colours also represent the sky and wheat fields — elements that hold significant meaning in Manitoba as well as in Ukrainian culture. The Ukrainian Coat of Arms symbolizes Ukrainian national identity and the country’s rich history and cultural heritage. Its integration with the Jets logo highlights the importance of the Ukrainian community in Manitoba.“I’ve realized my passion for designing in the sports industry, particularly for the Winnipeg Jets and Manitoba Moose,” said Sobchuk. “I’m excited to be the designer of the logo for Ukrainian Heritage Night and to share the rich culture and spirit of Ukraine with our community.”Apparel featuring the Jets Ukrainian Heritage logo is available now at all Jets Gear locations and at truenorthshop.com, with expanded merchandise to be available leading up to the holiday season and the Jan. 2 game.https://www.nhl.com/jets/news/winnipeg-jets-unveil-ukrainian-heritage-night-logo"

"The Only Way the Ukraine War Can End","The article makes a lot of good points, and I think this section shows the most direct path to victory:“We aren’t identifying, funding, and empowering the young Ukrainian engineers who are inventing new forms of asymmetric warfare. With a few exceptions, Ukrainians tell me, many allied armies aren’t in regular contact with the people carrying out cutting-edge military experiments in Ukraine. Oleksandr Kamyshin, Ukraine’s minister of strategic industries, says that the Ukrainians have spare capacity in their own drone factories, and could produce more themselves if they just had the money. Meanwhile, $300 billion worth of frozen Russian reserves are still sitting in European clearinghouses, untouched, waiting for a political decision to use that money to win the war.”Ukraine can build its own weapons, free from outside rules about where they can be used. And Moscow will pay for those weapons. "

That is the ancient Russian tradition and if it was good enough for the 16th century it should be good enough today, right??But for these sneaky Ukrainians apparently the 16th century isn't good enough.

"Ukrainian forces withdraw from Vuhledar, military announces","Unfortunately every time the Ukrainian army has to withdraw from a city, it becomes very hard to liberate it. Russians turn the buildings into rubble and turn the fields into minefields. The counteroffensive in Zaporizhzhia showed how hard taking back land is. I can't imagine what it would take to take back Vuhledar, Avdiivka, Marinka, Bakhmut, Lysychansk, Sievierodonetsk, Rubizhne, and Popasna.The West should send more military aid to Ukraine to prevent more cities from falling. It is tragic being in the most powerful alliance in the world and watching Russia taking over cities and being unable to stop it."

"What does it mean?","From speaking with a lot of Ukrainians over the past 2 years, I would interpret this to mean that she intends to come, but that she knows that life doesn’t always go as planned. In other words “I will put in the effort required to be there, but if there is an earthquake, please understand that my plans may change.”Ukrainians tend to be quite blunt, at least by Canadian standards, but words don’t always translate perfectly. If she didn’t want to come, I would have expected her to say “I’m sorry I am very busy with work right now” or something like that."

"What does it mean?","I remember a Swedish singer saying she had a project to record art songs by ""unpopular"" composers.

"About 23 hours left for a $2 chance to win a VERY used plate and/or a patch from the 93rd!","Each week, we raffle off something cool and uniquely Ukrainian for the benefit of Ukraine's frontline defenders. Yesterday, October 1, was Defenders Day, when Ukraine honors those who protect and defend it from the aggressor to the east. So this week we raffle items from defenders, for defenders.    **Handpainted icon on plate that saved a defender's life**    A religious icon handpainted on a very decidedly used armor plate. There are six dents in the plate. The soldier lived.    The icon was painted by Zhytomyr-based artist Olena Bukata. Ms. Bukata uses acrylic paint to transform such war trophies into works of art, which she then donates, sells, or auctions to benefit the war effort.    You can read more about Ms. Bukata and her work at [Ukrinform](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-culture/3821215-zitomirska-hudoznica-malue-ikoni-na-prostrilenih-plastinah-broneziletiv.html) and [Suspilne](https://suspilne.media/682484-zitomirska-hudoznica-malue-ikoni-na-prostrilenih-plastinah-broneziletiv-suspilne-ludi/).    The plate measures 33 cm x 26 cm.    **Patch from the fearsome 93rd, now fighting in Pokrovsk**    \^ That.    Proceeds from this raffle will support Ukraine Front Line's mission to fulfill direct requests from frontline defenders. This week, for example, we're working on tacmed for no fewer than three units who need resupply, and we just bought some FPV goggles for a drone operator in the 82nd.    As always, tickets are $2 and you may buy as many as you wish. Please note, however, that Givebutter limits individual purchases to batches no larger than 10.    [**Get your tickets here!**](https://givebutter.com/Ojl3Z3)    Good luck!    Please note    Though the event description mentions a livestream, there will be none. And while we do deeply appreciate those of you who choose to donate as well as buying raffle tickets, we want to make it clear that donations are not required to enter the raffle."

"Giving Blood Q.","u/Northernsoul73  - I am currently on a business trip so do not have much time free, but here is a C&P of some answers l gave a few weeks back on giving blood on our last Aid mission ,while l wait for my flight  . - Blood is needed for the wounded: Lviv residents are invited to donate at the City Blood Service Center. Lviv residents or visitors are urged to donate blood for the wounded & to replenish stocks . Donations can be made at the City Blood Service Center, which is open from 8:30 a.m. to 1:30 p.m. on weekdays at 9 Mykolaychuk StreetPlease look at taking the time to donate blood as your way of paying back your 'war tourism' holiday,an hour out of your trip will make a valuable contribution to the Ukrainian people . This was my 14th Aid mission since the invasion began & we donate blood each time ,all up our Aid group has made 135 Blood Donations over that time . Our Aid group is largely made up of Combat veterans so we all know well the importance of well stocked blood banks & many have benefited from it ,some multiple times ie myself twice. There is an urgent need for the Ukrainian Blood Bank reserves to be replenished as they are running on low reserves currently as there were many laceration injuries from the orc missile attacks in Lviv etc., on top of increased casualties with the uptake in clashes on the front lines alongside the Kursk push. Many civilians overlook the important role Blood Banks play behind the scenes , not only without them would the fatality rate be much higher on the front lines , but also wounds like amputations use a huge amount . With unprotected civilian areas being struck by orc's regularly, as in the recent orc missile strike on Lviv,you have buildings with large glass frontage, not only the fatalities but also recovery rate would be much longer for people who need complicated surgery/plastic surgery from lacerations etc. from flying glass etc.The staff at the Blood Bank in Lviv are lovely,(as are the snacks & coffee) & remember us each time now,( you take your passport for ID ) ,they are just as efficient & professional as the Blood Banks we have visited in the US etc ."

"It's the Defenders Day raffle! Today, a dented, lifesaving plate, and a patch from the almighty 93rd, who are currently in Pokrovsk.","**It's Defenders Day.**Each week, we raffle off something cool and uniquely Ukrainian for the benefit of Ukraine's frontline defenders. Today, October 1, is Defenders Day, when Ukraine honors those who protect and defend it from the aggressor to the east. So today we raffle items from defenders, for defenders.**Handpainted icon on plate that saved a defender's life**A religious icon handpainted on a very decidedly used armor plate. There are six dents in the plate. The soldier lived.     The icon was painted by Zhytomyr-based artist Olena Bukata. Ms. Bukata uses acrylic paint to transform such war trophies into works of art, which she then donates, sells, or auctions to benefit the war effort.    You can read more about Ms. Bukata and her work at [Ukrinform](https://www.ukrinform.ua/rubric-culture/3821215-zitomirska-hudoznica-malue-ikoni-na-prostrilenih-plastinah-broneziletiv.html) and [Suspilne](https://suspilne.media/682484-zitomirska-hudoznica-malue-ikoni-na-prostrilenih-plastinah-broneziletiv-suspilne-ludi/).    The plate measures 33 cm x 26 cm.**Patch from the fearsome 93rd, now fighting in Pokrovsk**\^ That.Proceeds from this raffle will support Ukraine Front Line's mission to fulfill direct requests from frontline defenders. This week, for example, we're working on tacmed for no fewer than three units who need resupply, and we just bought some FPV goggles for a drone operator in the 82nd.    As always, tickets are $2 and you may buy as many as you wish. Please note, however, that Givebutter limits individual purchases to batches no larger than 10.[**Get your tickets here!**](https://givebutter.com/Ojl3Z3)Good luck!**Please note**Though the event description mentions a livestream, there will be none.

Since then Ukrainian defense companies have been able to maintain and refurbish both missiles and systems but they were unable to start domestic manufacturing - Sophisticated SAM missiles are easily some of the most cost prohibitive price per unit items you can manufacture. At one time Ukroboronprom was marketing a Buk/S-300 mashup, but like many 2000’s Ukrainian defense projects there was no money and it was just on paper. Supposedly, since 2020, Ukraine has been working on developing replacement S-300 missiles - including test fires. This is one of the areas the US has been working with them to get them over the hump and manufacturing their own ammo.So the that long answer is, for the S-300, maybe?Buk - the focus here seems to be integrating western Sea Sparrow into it and using those for reloads. Most NATO countries have sunset the Sea Sparrow as an active AD system so there are literally thousands of reloads available for Ukraine. They are shorter range than the Buk missiles but comparable and numerous. To my knowledge Ukraine is not producing reloads.Osa - don’t see many Osa anymore, really on either side. Ukraine seems to have gotten a number of reloads from some North African countries and Jordan going off visual evidence but they are probably scarce. Doesn’t look like they are trying to make more.Strella is basically a sidewinder equivalent - think the old Chaparral. Ukraine has been getting a hodgepodge of western systems that approximate it in capability - Britain strapped ASRAAM on a truck and the US gave them a bunch of Avengers. Probably more worth their time to get them some Chaparrel’s or convert the Strella to carrying Sidewinder. Doubt they are making missiles for them."

Somehow my grandpa got ahold of it and it ended up in Washington State looking like it had been living in a river. The first time it fired, it shot flames out of the barrel from all the rust and dirt still embedded in the threads, even though I had thoroughly cleaned it. Now it shoots fine.I think that a few of these guns could be restored, but they're not worth anything."

Nobody expects that.- but I think you may get more ""points' if you do (from common human pov)- there is a traditional thing with flowers - even number is for funeral (you may remember this like a symmetry), odd number - for life. Our people think it is bad omen to give even number of flowers- just a common thing - don't speak about sex-related topics with her parents. Our parents often are very traditional and modest in stuff like this. It is very very bad to bring something like that, even a joke. We don't discuss sex with parents, and prefer to think nobody in the family has it :DIn general - I think they will be more stressed than you. Depending on their level of income, it might be that they don't know how to behave in a restaurant (my parents don't know that).

A drone struck his car as he was delivering humanitarian aid to residents in the border village of Kozacha Lopan,3 women who were also in the vehicle were hospitalized as a result of their injuries"" Article -Four people, including a judge on Ukraine’s Supreme Court, were killed and nine more were injured in two Russian airstrikes on villages in eastern Ukraine’s Kharkiv region on Saturday, local officials said.The Kharkiv regional Prosecutor’s Office said that a 61-year-old Supreme Court judge had been killed in what it described as a “cynical attack” when a Russian drone struck his car as he was delivering humanitarian aid to residents in the border village of Kozacha Lopan at around 1pm local time on Saturday afternoon. Three women who were also in the vehicle were hospitalised as a result of their injuries, it added.Ukraine’s Supreme Court later identified the judge as Leonid Loboyko, whom it described as a “kind, wise, and compassionate person” who had worked in the country’s Criminal Cassation Court.Three more men were killed and six people were injured in a separate strike on the nearby village of Slatyne several hours later, the Prosecutor’s Office said, with a shop, houses, and an educational institution all reportedly damaged by guided aerial bombs in the attack.The Prosecutor’s Office announced it had opened investigations into both attacks for premeditated murder and the violation of the laws and customs of war, and that law enforcement agencies were taking “all possible and appropriate measures to document the war crimes committed by Russian forces”.The attacks on the Kharkiv region came just hours after a Russian drone strike on a hospital in the capital of Ukraine’s northeastern Sumy region killed 10 people and injured 22 more on Saturday morning, with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky accusing Russia of “waging war on hospitals, civilian objects and people’s lives” and saying the attack proved that “only strength can force Russia into peace”."

I don't remember if I've already told you about him, but just in case, I'll tell you a little bit about him again. This man has been working as a paramedic in our village for a long time on an ambulance. Then, because of his low salary, he quit his job and went to Europe to work as a construction worker. He stayed there for 2 years and returned in 2022 when the war broke out. For three years now, he has been helping the sick, evacuating the wounded and dead, searching for remains and writing reports. I thought he was a titan. Over these three years, he has changed three drivers, because the guys just can't handle the load like he can. Recently, he had a coronavirus infection and has some heart complications, and in this photo he doesn't look good, and I'm even a little worried about him. Andriy also constantly travels between the soldiers of his unit to find out their needs, and then asks them to help, and brings them Starlink and generators from you:) This time Andriy's unit needs a 6 kW diesel generator. It costs $1200, but most of the amount is thanks to Reddit contributors who sent money for any need and IT specialists my PayPal is ktc.if1986@gmail.com It is very late and I am not thanking everyone personally (I will do it tomorrow), I am just stopping the collection and hugging everyone. thanks to you, the guys and I have faith in tomorrowhttps://www.reddit.com/u/CF_Siveryany/s/mSP2Vf3wO4"

"Commander of Ukraine's 72nd Brigade transferred amid battle for Vuhledar",">According to Operational Command ""North,"" Vinnik was transferred ""for the purpose of promotion and to transfer combat experience.""Could just be what it says on the tin.  Vinnik's command of the defense of Vuldehar has clearly been effective.  If the Ukrainian general staff feels that his brigade has enough depth of ability in its officer corps, then he himself is no longer needed for continued success -- the ultimate achievement of any good leader.And he might be very much indeed needed elsewhere, at a higher command level, to shore up area defense.  Both Russia and Ukraine have long known that if Vuldehar does ever fall it will be because Russia has succeeded operationally, not because the defenders of Vuldehar itself are overcome.So maybe taking the guy responsible for Vuldehar's success and putting him in charge of the larger operational domain is exactly what they need.There could always be something going wrong here, for reasons that we cannot see from the outside.  But sometimes a battlefield promotion due to competence and success is just what it looks like.  In the absence of any reason to believe otherwise, that seems like the most reasonable assumption."

"Short video of my solo trip to Ukraine (Kyiv, Zaporizhzhia and Lviv)","I want to thank everyone who, even before my trip, helped me with the organization of it. This already gave me an idea of the kindness of Ukrainians, and from the moment I took my bus from Warsaw to Kyiv, I discovered the wonderful people who inhabit this country—so kind, with hearts of gold, so brave, and extraordinary.I went to Ukraine alone, with only a basic understanding of the language, which I had started learning because of a girl I was dating back home. She broke my heart, so I went to Ukraine to clear my mind. I arrived with a broken heart, but I fell in love with its people, its food, its culture, its architecture, its green landscapes, its small cafés, and every hidden corner of each city.I met incredible people who made this experience unique, and I hold a special place in my heart for Zaporizhzhia. My guide there, a historian and teacher, taught me so much, and I learned so many things about the culture and history of the country and the region that it became the most special part of my journey. Now, I can only think about moving to Ukraine, improving my Ukrainian, and continuing to learn about this country and everything surrounding it.I am sure that Ukraine will soon shine again, brighter than ever before. I thank everyone who made this the best experience of my life.Слава Україні!"

They have speakers all around the park that play voices, re-telling stories from the people who died there. The main installation is a huge metal circle with many podiums on it, and the whole thing is covered with fake bullet holes. When you walk on it, the material creates a sound of bones crackling almost. They have eye holes you can look into and select a language, and it tells you the story of that particular person.It is a very eerie place, but also a beautiful memorial park that they have built.

Putin only cares about himself. Everything is for him and him alone. If it makes him look good in the eyes of his slave, er - citizens - or his cronies? Sure. Great. Make them work for him harder, and with that fear of failure to keep them going.Putin wants to be the next Peter the Great. He wants to be a modern day Tsar. Can't do that when Russia is an irradiated wasteland, and at best, he must live underground in some bunker complex. Or had been incinerated by a nuke. No, Putin loves his luxuries, his fine foods, his mansions, his clothing and cars, his women and obscene displays of wealth hidden away or actually on display, known to the knowing eye too much to risk the discomfort or spectre of death that comes from war with the West."

They shouldn't be ignored, but in the context of Ukraine they should be disregarded.If Putin loses the war he and his cronies will concoct some excuse that keeps their populace pliant.

Will they carry erythrocytes (has to be kept between 4.5-6 degrees for max 24 hours) or freeze dried plasma?- what about a bag valve mask, without this the surgical airways and such are of no use.Otherwise it looks awesome, would have loved to hear som more about the medications and seen all the equipment laid out in detail."

"Ukrainian Special Operation Forces use Black Hornet nano-drone in the Kursk oblast","I'm happy the Ukies are having better luck using these things than we did. My last deployment we took one out and lost it because a fucking bird attacked it."
"Ukrainian Special Operation Forces use Black Hornet nano-drone in the Kursk oblast","I first witnessed these being used on the battlefield in Afghanistan in 2013 & they had been in use well before that ,mainly being used for clearing compounds . As l have posted before a lot of the gear civilians are claiming is new being used in Ukraine "" basically a testing ground"" is years old battlefield proven technology .My last time personally being involved in their use was during the Xmas of 2016, when l was embedded with the Iraqi Special Operations Forces (ISOF),mentoring them while they did raids for High Value Targets etc. , for the start of the Battle Of Mosul,by then at a guess at least a half a dozen different ISAF member countries had them in their inventory . Even back then despite how many seem to have forgotten ,drone use was common & many of their targeted functions were just as easily provided by the larger drones both commercial & the Iraqi DIY versions . These Hornets IMO are of limited capability for general battlefield use & more suited to SF use, as they are heavily affected by weather conditions & their short air time is dramatically reduced in windy etc. conditions . The units we used back then ,(hopefully improved),had an expected Max 20 min flight time, but in reality could only be used at 15 min Max intervals ,so with the 2 per station field kit you had to bank on max 30 mins use & then a 45-min recharge.They were very good for providing aerial views of high walled compounds we were clearing & were found to be most effective ran at 100mtrs high where they were not only silent but virtually invisible ,so we would catch insurgents,firing points , arming IEDs & booby traps etc as well as detecting their escape routes & hiding spots ,weapons being hidden ,stashes etc .For specialized tasks like facial IDing individuals with their HQ cameras they were great,the best operators l saw on them were the UK guys ,they are not as quiet as some would think ,so they would hover them at height above suspected HVT's & then slowly lower them until the target looked up to see what the strange noise was ,this would give them the chance to use the cameras to their full potential to confirm ID .  In urban combat they were not as useful for close observation as expected as they are easily combated ,but again when used with background noise,down wind & height to obscure their presence they were very good for detecting hasty booby traps & escape route interdiction & observing inside bomb damaged buildings etc .The Ukrainians as usual will throw the instruction manuals out & adapt them to best suit their desired outcomes,so maybe we will hear of orcs being stabbed to death by a black hornet  outfitted with one of those Zaporizzya cossacks combat knife called a  “kolodach” taped to it  ;)"
"Ukrainian Special Operation Forces use Black Hornet nano-drone in the Kursk oblast","I do wonder, does Russia has the equivalent of the Black Hornet in their arsenal that is publicly known?"
"Ukrainian Special Operation Forces use Black Hornet nano-drone in the Kursk oblast","What does it do - are there explosives in it, or is it just for surveillance?"
"Just my 2 cents","Honestly, I was surprised as were many others when Wagner made it halfway to Moscow before changing their minds.  During that brief time, Putin fled in his private jet.   It tells me that Russia is far less powerful than they claim to be.Now, we have Ukraine making mince meat of 600,000 Russians.  It’s a war of attrition though in that it’s a David vs. Goliath situation.  Russia can send more people, even if poorly trained, into the battlefield than Ukraine can.  Thus, bold Ukrainian action must be taken to eventually cut the head off the Russian snake."
"Just my 2 cents","Thank you, u/Madge4500, you’re a real one.Ukraine has a great friend in you. I’m really grateful for all you do."
"Just my 2 cents",">give that little shit an ultimatum, get out of Ukraine and stay out of Ukraine or we ALL send our armies to meet yoursIronically, this ultimatum could be just enough. You won't even have to turn all of your words into actions, just take a stand. Putin is a coward and he only does what you let him to.p.s. thank you for your kind heart!"
"Just my 2 cents","I feel this too. Just a boiling frustration that this can't end - finally - and in Ukraines favor. They are fighting so hard for this. So hard."
"Just my 2 cents","The anger and rage that I feel that the world has stood by and let this happen to Ukraine has effected me deeply. I would be volunteering there if it weren’t for my husband being terminally ill. I do what I can from afar, donate money, buy Ukrainian products, write the White House weekly and fly a Ukrainian flag in front of my house. It just doesn’t feel like enough……"
"Just my 2 cents","Seconding Jester, Madge. I'm so thankful Ukraine has you for a friend."
"Just my 2 cents","My words"
"Just my 2 cents","Yep I don't know what every country is afraid of now that Ukraine has some Russian territory, send everything to Ukraine now, if not they are the ones allowing  the deaths and destruction of Ukraine."
"Just my 2 cents","Well said, u/Madge4500. I must correct you however:  your words are not a rant. You articulated a well-reasoned argument for appropriate action based on a clear assessment of the strategic situation and the stakes.Your arguments are grounded not just in logic but in the moral and emotional imperatives that come from a firm conviction in right vs. wrong. This only gives more power to the response you suggest.The free nations of the world should act as you say, from a position of strength and moral clarity and give the moskovite invaders a clear, unmistakable stop sign."
"Just my 2 cents","Slava ukraini"
"Just my 2 cents","In a ironical way Putin is very good for the western world to freshen up again - western world was stagnated in peace and economic success. Everybody needed reminding what is really freedom and bravery to fight and die for it - Ukraine has given exactly this. All the heros visible and all the shitheads also, difficult to hide."
"Just my 2 cents","Now thats the only way to face a bully, but sadly our governments are just too afraid of losing votes to man up."
"Just my 2 cents","Me personally, would rather face the risk of a nucleair war than let nazis do their thing again. What good is our race if we sit by and watch evil."
"Just my 2 cents","I've seen many words for Putin, but Kremlin Garden Gnome is a new one. Hehe."
"Just my 2 cents","It's nuts for two reasons. 1) if the West had even just declared it was willing to use force to remove Russia, they almost certainly would have backed down, from day 1 up to this very day2) if for some bizzare reason the Russians needed a proof of concept, the west could have destroyed their military without ever putting boots on the ground. The west easily had enough air power to turn anything Russian on wheels, treads or tracks into scrap metal. This would remove their ability to do anything. And most of us knew they were all bluster from the start. I called several things wrong about the war. I thought it'd be over quick. But there's never been any way for Russia to stand up to the west, if it flexed even at all."
"Just my 2 cents","I am not sure what the thinking was before the war. Zelensky shocked them all, when, he came out and said, 'I don't need a ride, I need weapons!' Before that, I think they were about to let Putin have his way."
"Just my 2 cents","It would be worse if Russia won.  I give money to Ukraine when I feel any pain.  My empathy opens my money.  Donating makes me feel better because I don't have any frustration from feeling powerless.  Giving money to Ukraine makes me powerful.  Glory to the heroes."
"Just my 2 cents","Being a Ukrainian-American I thank you greatly and deeply for having such a heart. I wish more Americans, specifically politicians, shared your sentiment. Слава і перемога Україні і котам!  Героям слава!!!💙💛🇺🇦🐱🐈"
"Just my 2 cents","I think the world should be going after putin directly and personally. He's no different to any other terrorist pos that gets hit by a reaper drone or similar.It's his war. Why is he immune from being targeted? It's bullshit."
"Just my 2 cents",">get out of Ukraine and stay out of Ukraine or we ALL send our armies to meet yours. Stop threatening with your nukes, you aren't the only country that has that capability.Unfortunately having a large nuclear stockpile just allows you to get away with more, you're not just asking for leaders to grow a backbone and allow Ukraine to strike in Russia rather you're asking them to put necks on the chopping block and put their own populations and futures at risk when we don't even have military pacts between one another. Nations around the world sending billions in aid to another country is already a historical new, a big power like America stepping in and stopping not nuclear imperalist powers invading their neighbors is also a historical new.Aid is the best middle ground you could ask for, foreign nations don't put their necks on the chopping block and the nation being invaded is able to survive the fight."
"Just my 2 cents","Then all the good guy proxy wars would fail too….. this isn’t a game of risk, this is just imperialism v40,000. Making the wealthy wealthier, protecting the wealthy so you can stay in power… repeat."
"Just my 2 cents","It's time to cociede what is lost and not bring any other countries into this. It is war, it sucks. Our countries have our own huge problems. My 2 cents."
"The 37th Marine Brigade Drone Unit That Is Fighting In a Hotspot Needs One A Power Station Which Cost $750. Your Help Is Highly Appreciated! ","Hello everyone. Armen here.I have several active requests from a few different brigades, one of them is the 37th who we bought 3 petrol power generators for a while ago.

"A railway bridge in the Samara region was blown up in Russia","The Russian government stated that the rails were undamaged but failed to say that the girders, the concrete road base, and other structurally significant points of the bridge were damaged and/or deformed in the blast. Sure, go ahead and send another train over that bridge. Make sure it’s carrying a ton of ammo and fuel first, though."
"A railway bridge in the Samara region was blown up in Russia","Ooh, yeah that one is toast.In the view of the side of the bridge, we see the box girder is bulged outward. Which means the girder is no longer rigid, the top isn't being supported much by the bottom any more and the sides have no strength as they're starting to buckle. Now, if that's only a short span that's damaged then they might be able to just slap a temporary repair on top. But they absolutely cannot send any more freight trains across without replacing the load bearing parts of that span, the existing girder is beyond safe repair."

"Ukraine's getting powerful long-range glide bombs from the US that will give its F-16s a new punch","Yep. Glide bombs, which I always thought were a dark horse in this war, are going to make a difference for Ukraine. The downside with them is they do have a long time before they hit targets. Example, going 50 miles for a 500 mph weapons takes 6 minutes. That means they aren't good for CAS, but good for hitting static targets. So expect them to make that happen."

"Losses of the Russian military to 29.9.2024","On the front lines, the Russian army’s offensive continued in the same directions.- In the Kursk region, Russian sources report that the Russian army has gained control over two settlements, but there has been no confirmation of this. Battles are ongoing at several points, but the Russian army has not yet managed to launch a major offensive.- In the northern part of Vovchansk in the Kharkiv direction, battles continue and there have been no significant changes in the situation.- A very active offensive continues towards the cities of Kupiansk and Lyman. Yesterday, the Russian army was not able to make significant progress. Social media channels reported advancements by Russian units in the Siversk direction yesterday. However, there has been no confirmation of this, and according to Ukrainian sources, it was relatively quiet in this sector.- In the Bahmut area, the pressure continues towards Chasiv Yar, but Russian units have not managed to improve their positions. Serious urban battles continue on the southern and eastern edges of Toretsk city. Since predominantly small infantry units operate in the grey zone of the front line, the situation in this limited area is very fluid. The Russian army has not achieved any major advancements.- On the Pokrovsk city direction, the pressure from Russian units slightly increased yesterday, but they only managed marginal improvements in their positions. The most severe attacks are continuing southwest of Donetsk, where Russian units have managed to move forward slightly in some points.- On the southern front, Russian units conducted a few reconnaissance battles and were generally passive. The local Ukrainian military command continues active communication, indicating that Russian units are preparing for a larger offensive in this area."

That group does some great work ,l believe recently they have focussed on helping out orphanages & children's hospitals as they are in terrible state . We delivered Aid to a couple of orphanages last year & unfortunately they are still run like in the soviet era ,it was pretty confronting,ie a lot of disabled kids,cages,older kids still wearing dirty cloth diapers etc  so their help will be desperately needed.

"Ukrainian Javelin vs Russian Tank","I assume this had a cope cage to contend with?How well are top attack AT faring with this?Pretty important to know, as if they are still effective in the future then they can be adapted for firing from drones. In theory top attack can be enhanced using two stage explosives, one in the nose that fires radically to penetrate the cafe, and then a shaped charge firing through this. But then, how effective will this be in the future with ERA undrr the cage?I assume gradually the effectiveness will decline requiring more modifications on the weapon.If they are still effective then this can be basis of a simpler low cost Javellin incorporating drone technology. The spotter drone laser designated the top if the tank, then a second drone, ground or airborne, launches a missile up and over to the general direction, using cheap INS to approximate a N arrival zone, look for the laser return, and dive down onto the target. This can be rocket or electric drone, but using a fast dive as compared to existing drones in the final approach.Existing batteries would not be very useful, for electric fast drones to replace missiles at potentially lower cost, they need very high power density and these would be short range, a few km, so the energy can mostly not be used. Higher power density batteries are needed but such an approach can mean firing from further away. Solid state batteries can get us there.This the future may be like this:1 ultra low observable (small) observation drone and laser designator, decent loiter time and range, may deploy AI object recognition if jammed. Reusable.2 Heavy lift drone carrying fast electric strike drones, kept at distance for low chance of observation. Reusable. 3 fast attack drone resembling a missile with potentially folding high loading wings, 5 to 10 km range, 250 to over 300kmph (as seen in existing racing drones, but here having to carry payload.)Top attack in dive."

"Mr. Snyder is based","Imo the only reason America has fought in so many wars that were not on home soil is because the country is separated from the majority of the world by 2 MASSIVE oceans. We would pick up on any invading forces LONG BEFORE they made landfall or invaded our air space. In regards to any wars that take place here, the only way I see it happening is if Canada or Central America allows a foreign force to use their territory as a staging ground.We also have active military bases with a large enough operating radius and in enough concentration (globally) that we can literally deploy to anywhere in the world, when needed, in a matter of hours. I dont remember the exact tuber or the name of the video, but recently saw a very informative and comprehensive video on youtube going over the range and capabilities of our international military bases, and I wasnt kidding. We literally are capable of deploying SOF or advanced operatives anywhere we need them, or our allies call for."

Imagine if FDR had told Stalin that he can only use leand-lease tanks and planes against Germans if they were inside the Soviet Union. Stalin and the world would have laughed at such a wimpy policy. Putin is the 2024 edition of good old Adolf. Invading his neighbors at will. It's the same thing and same motivation and needs to be defeated the same old way with guns and bullets.

Just as a thought problem - if Russia invades Georgia next week (GW Bush pushed for Georgia to be admitted to NATO, also), do we begin supplying Georgia with weapons and aid? Is that sustainable?3. Ian Bremmer the other day said the quiet part out loud - that no one believes the Ukraine  war will end without Ukraine giving up territory.

So here goes nothing.I am, or have been, a libertarian leaning voter. And as such I have more in common with a lot more conservatives than I do liberals.  In all honesty, I have been hoping to see the Trump campaign offer unwaivering support for Ukraine.  As now, in my opinion, it is clear that that the Putin regime presents a serious threat to the west.I have written the Trump administration on 4 occasions asking for public clarification on his position in Ukraine and have been ignored. Seeing this video makes it clear to me that Trump doesn't value the unimaginable sacrifices that Ukraine has made, or the goals they have set to restore their sovereignty.  They are being oppressed and they are fighting back with all that they have and losing everything they love in doing so.This video hurts.  Evil cannot be bargained with.  Trump seems to think everyone can make a deal.Zelenskyy is a man of valor.  A true leader to be emulated.  He is so inspiring.  If only US politicians these days could demonstrate such a resolve against the forces of evil.I will not vote for any candidate that will not stand against Russia.  So Trump will not be getting my vote so long as he tries to politic his way through a war where family pets are being hung from fences, women and children being raped, and plundering and torturing occurs under Putin's authority."

Trump (unsurprisingly) can not for 2 seconds stop talking about himself and justifying his shitty actions.  The only thing he did was bash democrats, spread misinformation, and praise himself. He literally can never do anything else.  Whether you think he's a good or bad person. You can not argue that he isn't broken. He is incapable of having a real conversation because his mind his so damaged by all the threats and accusations and convictions,  it's like he has PTSD and every time he opens his mouth he feels he has to defend himself.  He's broken and not normal. 3. Putin is so far down Trumps throat that he can't even pretend to not support him, ""I have a very good relationship with Putin"" ""it takes 2 to tango""  it's giving very ""good people on both sides"" energy. Trump both fears Putin, probably because Putin has dirt on Trump. And Putin is playing Trump because he is weak and easy to manipulate with praises and money.  Trump is a picture perfect example of a person who would be denied a secret clearance in the military or govt. This was absolutely brutal to watch.

It seems almost every element of the U.S federal government foreign apparatus is in favor of supporting Ukraine in one way or another.Despite the constant hyperbole from political bots, it is still unclear what Trump would do. Though experts have speculated the only way he could realistically force a white peace would be to withdraw support for Ukraine on the proviso Russia withdraws its forces, with exact details on who retains what control areas completely an unknown. That doesn't seem like a great outcome for Ukraine, and doesn't really seem palatable for Russia either. It would also be unheard of for Putin led Russia to allow the U.S to publicly play peace broker here. Eitherway it isn't over for Ukraine if Trump is elected. There is a lot of support both within and external to the U.S."

Trump is such a disgrace and such a pathetic loser.You have to recognize that there are evil forces in this world that are not for peace. That there are aggressive forces, and unless you stop these aggressive forces, you are not going to have real peace. You have to recognize that if you, in the name of peace, roll over in front of an aggressor. This may ensure peace maybe not in your time but our time, but it ensures war at a later time.The Munich agreement is the prime example. I was always against appeasement, not because I was for war. But because I was for peace for a generation for a century rather than peace in my own time.""Richard Nixon, 37th president of the United StatesWe in America have learned bitter lessons from two World Wars: It is better to be here ready to protect the peace, than to take blind shelter across the sea, rushing to respond only after freedom is lost. We’ve learned that isolationism never was and never will be an acceptable response to tyrannical governments with an expansionist intent.But we try always to be prepared for peace; prepared to deter aggression; prepared to negotiate the reduction of arms; and, yes, prepared to reach out again in the spirit of reconciliation. In truth, there is no reconciliation. We would welcome more than a reconciliation with the Soviet Union, so together, we can [listen] lessen the risks of war, now and forever.Ronald Reagan, Remarks on the 40th Anniversary of D-Day, delivered 6 June 1984 in Pointe Du Hoc, Normandy, FranceToday, we speak to all in Eastern Europe who were separated from neighbors and loved ones... and to every person trapped in tyranny, whether in Ukraine, Poland.. we send our love and support and tell them they are not alone.
