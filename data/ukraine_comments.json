To collect money for a cheap used car from Europe (it is like 5 000$, which is the lowest minimum) it takes to do something extra. Like shave a head on stream or create a song about that. It is damn hard to collect a needed sum, even this relatively small one. \n\nNo, the gov doesn't pay for that, it is too slow, soldiers pay their salaries for everything: good shoes, good gear, first aids, etc, etc, etc. People donate money on buying cars or drones. Recently I saw a donation for a unit which had to leave their positions, they lost everything, and they needed some tools to dig trenches. \n\nIf we spread these awesome cars on the length of frontline, there will be 1 car per 1 km. It is not enough at all. I just write all of this so you understand - Ukrainians are not greedy when they say \"it is not enough\". It is just a massive war on huge territories, against the enemy who has almost the full USSR army and their supplies on its side.",

This is why modern Turkey, Romania and Bulgaria have old and strong Crimean Tatar communities.\n\nCrimean Tatars have never been persecuted under Ukrainian rule. This is why Erdogan \u2013 invoking the centuries-old Turkish-Crimean Tatar ties \u2013 keeps reiterating that Crimea belongs to Ukraine.
